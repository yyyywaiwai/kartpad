# External display work and device checks

AirPlay and external output on iPhone/iPad, plus Android external output, are
accepted product priorities. This is an implementation and acceptance plan,
not a claim that the current builds support every output path. Apple report
[#100](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/100) describes a visible
chooser followed by black video with audio continuing.

## First delivery target

Keep the running game visible through system mirroring. Start with wired
output so the renderer/surface behavior can be isolated, then validate AirPlay
and Android's available wireless mirroring separately. A TV-only game view with
controls retained on the handheld is a subsequent feature with separate input
and surface ownership; it should not block correcting broken mirroring.

| Path | First acceptance |
| --- | --- |
| iPhone/iPad wired mirroring | Chooser → Original → offline race, then Retro; connect before and after launch; disconnect returns usable local video/input. |
| iPhone/iPad AirPlay mirroring | Repeat the same sequence; check video/audio continuity and steering latency separately from wired results. |
| Android USB-C mirroring or desktop window | Record the actual device mode; check launch, display move/resize, game menu and unplug/reconnect. USB-C alone does not establish video-output capability. |
| Android wireless mirroring | Identify the actual receiver/mirroring route and compare the same offline scene; do not infer support from a wired pass. |

Start at 1x/4:3, with Android Renderer Validation off. Use an offline race and
change one setting/connection condition at a time. Record device/OS, app build,
TV/monitor, adapter/cable or receiver, which screen fails, and whether the
handheld, audio and game menu keep responding. A short clip of both displays
is useful; hide notifications and do not include personal identifiers.

## Source findings and next implementation boundary

The Apple game build uses `apple/ios/RuntimeInfo.plist` and SDL's UIKit scene
and Metal-view path. The native shell app delegate alone is not the game
renderer. Its manifest currently declares an application scene, and there is
no KartPad-owned dedicated external game scene. The pinned SDL backend observes
screen connections and sizes its Metal drawable from the view. Those paths need
hardware evidence at the chooser-to-game transition before a fix is asserted.
A dedicated external scene is a separate UIKit role; see
[Apple's external-display scene documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscenesession/role-swift.struct/windowexternaldisplaynoninteractive).

Android currently renders through a single SDL `KartPadSurface`, with native
locking around create/change/destroy callbacks. There is no KartPad-owned second
presentation surface. First validate this activity as the display/context and
surface change; do not add a second runtime instance. Android's
[connected-display guidance](https://developer.android.com/develop/adaptive-apps/guides/support-connected-displays)
requires handling display changes and resizing. A later separate output view
can evaluate [Presentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Presentation)
against the existing renderer's surface ownership.

No external-output fix or physical acceptance is established by this source
review. For this release cycle, an iPhone/iPad candidate must remain local for
owner testing before a formal IPA is published. Each platform needs its own
acceptance; Android or Mac success does not establish iPad support.

## Surface recreation ownership finding

The [bounded recovery audit](artifacts/2026-09-09/external-display-surface-ownership.md)
identified new SDL Metal views replacing the root during surface recreation while
KartPad controls remain on the previous root. Reuse/destruction and control
ownership need a forced-recovery test; display attachment causing that recovery
and TV-only black video remain unconfirmed. This is separate from dedicated
external output and does not authorize a scheduled IPA publication.

The [native recovery correction and tests](artifacts/2026-09-09/apple-metal-surface-recovery.md)
now preserve one Metal view per window. macOS and iPhone/iPad simulator probes
pass repeated descriptor recreation, presentation and teardown, with failing
unpatched controls. tvOS probe compilation also passes. Full-game surface loss
and physical external-output acceptance remain open; this does not close #100.
