# KartPad release checklist

## iPhone/iPad 0.4.11 console-serial hotfix

- [x] Retain the credited upstream fix and host/Android ARM64 regressions.
- [x] Rebuild the native ARM64 iPhone/iPad app as 0.4.11/build 26; app audit passes.
- [x] Inspect the linked serial routine: numeric byte reversal and a four-byte
      store replace the old string write; 140 Python tests and source/safety
      checks pass.
- [x] Merge release metadata, rebuild from exact main, package twice and audit.
- [x] Publish the new IPA/checksum, anonymously download and re-audit.
- [x] Update issue #94 with the verified download and remaining boundaries.

Old packages remain offline-only; the Mac and tvOS rebuilds are tracked below. No new physical
online race or server-history cleanup is inferred from these checks.

## macOS 0.4.11 console-serial hotfix

- [x] Rebuild both executable profiles from freshly patched source.
- [x] Audit the signed app and inspect the linked corrected serial write.
- [x] Run bounded local launch/close checks without touching installed saves.
- [x] Merge metadata, package exact main twice and audit extracted signatures.
- [x] Publish only Mac ZIP/checksum, anonymously download and re-audit.
- [x] Update issue #94 and the current download documentation.

## First Android community release (v0.4.10-android.1)

- [x] Owner accepts Original/Kishi gameplay, automatic touch hiding and reports
      Retro WFC worldwide live racing on the physical Pixel.
- [x] Keep performance/device/controller limits explicit; preserve phone data.
- [x] Integrate current main licensing and the upstream issue #94 serial backport.
- [x] Rebuild the native runtime, pass host and ARM64 serial regressions, and
      inspect the corrected linked four-byte write.
- [x] Audit AAB/APK, reject debug signing and wrong versions, derive identical
      signed APK bytes twice, and verify fresh emulator install/import entry.
- [x] Merge reviewed source and publish only APK, notices and checksums.
- [x] Download hosted files anonymously, compare and re-audit exact bytes.

See [candidate verification](artifacts/2026-09-07/android/first-release-verification.md)
and [release maintenance](RELEASING_ANDROID.md). Original public-signature
physical installation, complete production-online results/reconnect, historical
server CSNum cleanup and sustained 60 FPS are not claimed.

## tvOS 0.4.11 console-serial hotfix

- [x] Prepare fresh dual runtime sources with the credited issue #94 correction.
- [x] Build ARM64 tvOS 0.4.11/build 9 and pass the app/RCpc/private-data audit.
- [x] Verify linked serial write and repository/source checks.
- [x] Merge metadata, rebuild exact main, package twice and audit exact IPA.
- [x] Publish only the tvOS IPA/checksum; anonymously download and re-audit.
- [x] Update issue #94 with the verified download and remaining server-history boundary.

No physical Apple TV test, production-online acceptance, DSU support or
external-display fix is inferred from this targeted rebuild.

Published and anonymously re-audited: [v0.4.11-tvos.1](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/v0.4.11-tvos.1).
See the [exact artifact and triage evidence](artifacts/2026-09-08/tvos-v0411-release.md).

## tvOS experimental candidate

- [x] Publish the physically untested artifact only as an explicit hardware-
      bring-up preview and direct initial testing to a small Apple TV cohort
      using [`docs/TVOS-TESTING.md`](TVOS-TESTING.md) and the acceptance matrix
      in [`docs/TVOS.md`](TVOS.md).
- [x] Label that artifact experimental and unaccepted until tester evidence
      completes the physical Apple TV matrix.
- [ ] Prove Original and Retro Rewind gameplay separately with an Extended
      Gamepad; do not infer Retro WFC acceptance from offline play.
- [ ] Back up and rehearse restore of Caches/KartPad before asking a
      tester to risk saved progress.
- [ ] Re-audit the exact signed tester artifact for private game data, Retro
      Rewind content, derived game artwork, signing material, and local paths.

The exact 67-row matrix in `docs/PRD.md` remains the authority for full
engineering completion. A community preview may ship with narrower, explicit
limitations when its exact artifact passes every preview gate below.

## 0.4.7 macOS first-class candidate

- [x] Build the one-command Mac workflow as dual Original / Retro Rewind
- [x] Validate the exact Retro Rewind folder before selecting that profile
- [x] Verify standard Game, Data, Controls, and Help menus in the built app
- [x] Verify original-game and Retro Rewind launch separately on macOS
- [x] Exercise keyboard gameplay input and the visible mouse/menu path
- [x] Verify controller mapping contracts; keep untested physical hardware
      claims explicit
- [x] Build and audit exact-source macOS 0.4.7 build 21
- [x] Build and audit exact-source iOS 0.4.7 build 21
- [x] Package each artifact twice byte-identically and audit the exact files
- [x] Publish `v0.4.7`, both artifacts, and `SHA256SUMS`
- [x] Download hosted assets, byte-compare, and re-audit them
- [x] Respond to and close issue #79 with the exact commands and evidence

The annotated `v0.4.7` tag resolves to source commit
`061e9bfe3c2e522e58087e908402dc545ae6c1a8`. The downloaded hosted artifacts
matched their local release bytes and passed their extracted-package audits:

- macOS ZIP: `37ae10bb384c776cdbd7596701363f8449c496faa6d6e551ec8d5073b05c38ab`
- iPhone/iPad IPA: `c5750fe718e05d8f18fa986d828de5276e8e721035b33c7cb8572f6d29ad683b`

The keyboard path reached the translated controller core, and the native
controller mapping plus four-slot contracts pass. No specific physical Mac
controller model was accepted in this release, so that hardware claim remains
bounded to the tested contracts and community reports.

## 0.4.6 license-management hotfix candidate

- [x] Enumerate active Original and Retro Rewind licenses by profile and slot
- [x] Rename one exact license without changing its creation ID or other data
- [x] Delete only one guarded license block after an explicit second warning
- [x] Revalidate the live save, back it up, write atomically, and repair CRC-32

- [x] Publish `v0.4.6`, `KartPad-v0.4.6-ios-unsigned.ipa`, and `SHA256SUMS`
- [x] Download hosted assets, byte-compare, and re-audit them

The in-place iPad installation retained the existing WBFS and byte-identical
console identity, Mii database, original save, Retro Rewind save, and
preferences. The same files remained intact after the first 0.4.6 launch.
