# KartPad and WiiCompiled reports

KartPad builds on [WiiCompiled](https://github.com/patchzyy/Wiicompiled), created
by [patchzyy](https://github.com/patchzyy). WiiCompiled supplies the original
Mario Kart Wii static translator and runtime. KartPad maintains its modified
Apple/Android integration, controls, installation and packaging. The projects
are independently maintained.

## Choose a destination

- **KartPad app, installation, touch controls, or an uncertain cause:** use the
  [KartPad issue chooser](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/new/choose).
- **A suspected WiiCompiled runtime problem, or using WiiCompiled directly:** use
  the [WiiCompiled issue chooser](https://github.com/patchzyy/Wiicompiled/issues/new/choose).
  KartPad users can submit directly; no KartPad maintainer handoff is required.
  Clearly identify the modified KartPad build and whether the problem has also
  been reproduced on unmodified WiiCompiled. **Not tested** is a valid answer.

[Search reports in both projects](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Aissue+repo%3Achrissotraidis%2Fkartpad+repo%3Apatchzyy%2FWiicompiled&type=issues)
and add evidence to a matching issue instead of creating another. If reports already exist in both projects, cross-link
them. You do not need to open one in each project.

A race crash or graphics problem can involve KartPad changes too; the symptom
alone does not establish ownership. You do not need to diagnose the source
code to ask for help. Use KartPad when unsure.

WiiCompiled's forms ask about its latest release and include Windows log paths.
Do not check a statement that is untrue for your KartPad build or claim that
KartPad logs came from a stock WiiCompiled run. If the available form requires
a claim you cannot make, use KartPad and link any relevant upstream issue.
Each project's maintainers decide which reports they can investigate.

## Collect once, review, then attach

Use the [platform collection steps](SUPPORT.md#collect-a-useful-report).

| Platform | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| Android | **Report a Problem…** for a short report; **Export Private Diagnostics…** for runtime logs. |
| iPhone / iPad | **••• → Report a Problem…**; review/share the file and attach it manually on GitHub. |
| macOS | **Help → Save Diagnostics Report…**; review the saved report before attaching. |
| Experimental tvOS | Use the [tvOS testing guide](TVOS-TESTING.md) and its diagnostic collection script. There is no promised mobile-style sharing flow. |

A report ID is not an upload. Opening GitHub does not attach a file. Share the
same reviewed evidence when adding information to a linked upstream report;
do not create duplicate issues merely to copy the logs.

Include the exact app/build, device and OS, Original or Retro Rewind and pack
version, steps, and the session/time of the failure. Runtime `console.log` and
`crash_*.txt` files, when present, are different from a short app summary or an
OS exit record. Keep their startup/version information and relevant failure
context. Do not label an old log with the version installed when exporting it.
Mark missing runtime revision or stock-WiiCompiled reproduction as **unknown**
or **not tested**; do not infer either from the current repository.

Review text before sharing: omit game data, saves, NAND, credentials, console
identities, personal paths and network/account identifiers. The private Android
archive is for local inspection, not automatic public upload. Keep your
installation and saves intact while troubleshooting.

## Reporting test builds

Direct reporting changes are available as prereleases:

- [Android code 90](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/v0.4.20-android-reporting.1)
- [iPhone/iPad build 42](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/v0.4.20-ios-reporting.1)

These leave stable downloads in place. Build/package checks passed; physical
reporting-flow acceptance remains pending. Android retains the public code85
runtime libraries; the Apple candidate was freshly prepared and compiled.
macOS reporting source is merged, but no new Mac package is announced here.
Older installed builds may still open only a KartPad draft.

In the **Android reporting candidate**, describe the problem, choose the visible
KartPad/WiiCompiled destination, then tap **Open GitHub Draft**. Both projects remain visible, and
**Search reports in both projects** opens a combined issue search. You do not need
to select a local file or explain missing logs first. Attach reviewed evidence
on GitHub. **Share Report…** is separate and still checks any selected file
before sharing it. **Save Diagnostic Log…** lets you choose the failed session and saves one
attachable text file. The saved file is selected automatically for review;
there is no archive to unpack.

In the **iPhone/iPad reporting candidate**, **Continue to GitHub…** shows
**Preparing Report…**, then a review screen. Choose **Choose Project — I’ll
Attach the Log** after review, or **Continue Without a Log**, then select
KartPad or WiiCompiled; the chooser also offers **Search Both Trackers**.
WiiCompiled reports have explicit Crash, Bug and Performance choices instead
of sending every report to the non-crash form. The draft opens in an embedded Safari view. Returning
from the destination choice or browser preserves the review; a loading failure
offers retry, copying the draft link, or returning to the report. Nothing is
submitted automatically. Apple still uses the existing current/previous-session
exporter rather than Android's session picker.

The [support guide](SUPPORT.md#collect-a-useful-report) describes logs and older
builds. These reporting changes do not establish gameplay stability or announce
a public release.

Repository migration is a separate decision; see
[Fork connection options](FORK-OPTIONS.md).

In macOS source, **Help → Report a Problem…** offers both destinations and
combined search. The upstream option opens its issue-template chooser. Saved
diagnostics preserve bounded runtime startup headers and failure tails. This
is source availability, not an announcement of a new Mac download.
