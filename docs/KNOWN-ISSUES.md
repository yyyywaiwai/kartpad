# KartPad known issues

Current priorities, available builds and pending tests live only in the
[maintenance board](MAINTENANCE-BOARD.md). Device/build facts below retain the
scope of the reports that supplied them. New [#184](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/184)
asks for Android shoulder-to-D-pad mapping; see the
[feature scope](FUTURE-FEATURES.md#android-d-pad-and-shoulder-remapping).

## Community reports reviewed 9 September 2026 (Japan time)

See the [support guide](SUPPORT.md) for workarounds and the exact diagnostic
steps. Open reports are not treated as verified root causes.
All 20 open GitHub issues were checked on 8 September 2026 at 21:52 UTC
(9 September, 06:52 Japan time), including their latest replies. The targeted
[Android investigation handoff](ANDROID-PERFORMANCE-HANDOFF.md) ranks the next
experiments and distinguishes installed, public and local candidate builds.
The [maintenance workflow](MAINTENANCE.md) defines how evidence advances into
reviewed fixes, platform tests and accepted builds.

The [Android device report register](TECH-DEBT.md#android-device-report-register)
records reported hardware, exact builds where available, successful milestones,
failures and remaining checks from the 9 September GitHub review. It distinguishes
logged driver versions from suspected causes and is not a compatibility certification.

The [9 September Reddit triage](artifacts/2026-09-09/reddit-android-report-triage.md)
maps additional Android reports to these issues and records setup, remapping
and resolution-change leads in [technical debt](TECH-DEBT.md#android-community-reports-and-flow-gaps).
Those comments omit exact APK versions and do not establish results for the
separate Android build/test workstream.

| Issue | Current boundary / next evidence |
| --- | --- |
| [#169](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/169) POCO save/performance/display report | POCO F6 Pro/Snapdragon8Gen2/12GB/Android 15,0.4.10-android.1/build 21, Original and Retro. Reports Retro progress lost after exit, poor FPS and unused display area. Save concern prioritized: missing license versus records/unlocks versus rating, exit path/same profile and existing save-error excerpt requested. No deliberate loss/reinstall requested. GPU cause, thermal throttling and applicability of newer fixes unverified. |
| [#166](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/166) HONOR graphics corruption | YLE-W09, Android 16/API36, exact preview 1/build 28, Original/base,1x Fill Screen, validation ON; report KP-13D4AF72. Reporter supplied Adreno829/Qualcomm driver512.842.36. Android owner inspected images: corruption across menu panels, models and race with HUD intact. Actual failing-draw cause remains unproven; no repeated settings/validation request. |
| [#167](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/167) Helio G200 performance | Reporter identifies Infinix Hot60Pro, Android 16/XOS16.3, HelioG200/MaliG57MC2/8GB and0.4.11Original; reports15–20 FPS gameplay/~30menus versus Dolphin50–60 FPS. Reporter confirms same performance at 1x in4:3 and16:9; Dolphin Vulkan felt smoother than OpenGL. Settings response acknowledged, no repeat benchmark. No hardware acceptance or shared-cause claim from other-device measurements. |
| [#142](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/142) AI disclosure and documentation | Answered publicly; disclosure shipped. README ordering and repository documentation cleanup merged in PR #148. Closed by Christopher after his follow-up; UI criticism is not a diagnosed rendering or performance defect. |
| [#137](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/137) preview 1 vertex explosion | Galaxy S26 Ultra/SM-S948B, Android 16, exact published cecd69c source fingerprints, Original/base and Retro not installed. Reported 4x/16:9 with validation active; settings changes did not resolve stretching. GPU/driver and actual-draw excerpts are not yet supplied. Keep related reports linked without asserting a shared cause or repeating broad settings/import tests. |
| [#143](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/143) Android game-launch crash | Honor X7D/Snapdragon685/Android 15, after import and Launch. Exact build/profile/import completion and matching exit/final console excerpt requested; no renderer/CPU cause inferred from device name. Video was not accessible to the review tool. No reinstall or full archive requested. |
| [#135](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/135) iPad opening crash | [Independent raw-crash review](artifacts/2026-09-09/issue-135-raw-crash-review.md) identifies faulting LDAPRB unsupported by A10X in supplied 0.4.0/build 15 report. Edited image list/redacted UUID limit exact binary identification. Published iOS build 29 startup and Original/Retro loading are now reporter-confirmed. Reporter describes unstable roughly 30FPS Retro and30–35 FPS Original at native resolution, versus Dolphin60FPS; these are reported comparisons, not controlled profiling. Performance remains open. No repeated raw-report or jailbreak-change request. |
| [#128](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/128), [#131](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/131) end-of-cup crash | AYN Thor Retro report and Poco X8 Pro/Android 16/HyperOS 3.1 report. #131 identifies tapping Next after the final Grand Prix race, before the ceremony, at fullscreen/3x/60 FPS; reporter now confirms Original and Retro are both affected (also mentions online). Matching reviewed exit/error excerpts are requested. Similar timing does not establish a shared cause or all-device impact. No repeat cup runs, reinstall or data clearing requested. |
| [#127](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/127) macOS two-player character offsets | Contributor reports M5 MacBook Air / macOS 27 beta / Original at PR #112 head 271fdc1, 4x, 120 FPS, borderless/notch extension. Controller input works; characters appear outside karts. Same-scene main comparison is pending; neither PR regression nor shared Android cause is established. |
| [#105](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/105) save location/transfer | [Android preview 1](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/v0.4.13-android-preview.1) adds matched offline rating restore. At 14:06 UTC on 8 September, after the build-28 test instructions, the reporter confirmed that ratings and offline information transferred successfully. Record reporter-confirmed success for that workflow and acknowledge it; do not repeat the completed test request. Full Mii migration, online/server synchronization and Apple parity are not established by this response. |
| [#102](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/102), [#104](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/104) Android geometry/textures | Fold #102 supplied Vulkan/Adreno 840 driver 512.842.19 logs confirming 1x/4:3, both screen states, Retro Rewind 6.12.7. A [synthetic renderer probe](../tools/renderer-probe/README.md) tests packed decoding and uniform layouts; Mac Metal and physical Pixel Vulkan baselines pass. Adreno 840 (512.842.19) and Adreno 750 (512.762.39 / 512.762.41) all pass the compute checks; the reporter confirms matching Original corruption and no logged GPU errors. The expanded [0.2.0 diagnostic](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/renderer-probe-v0.2.0) now tests synthetic indexed draws, textures and queued updates; the #104 reporter also passes all eight compute/draw checks on Adreno 750 / 512.762.41. Adreno 840 draw results remain open. #104 confirmed corruption at 1x/4:3 affecting drivers only, with vehicles/tracks correct; no more repeat logs are requested from that reporter. Character transforms and generated shaders need a failing-draw reproduction; #102’s road-texture symptom remains separate. Build-23 actual-game validation on/off is now complete on the Fold: unchanged corruption, no crash, and the supplied interval presents near 60 FPS with no queued pipelines. No repeat comparison is requested. The #104 reporter also confirms unchanged driver corruption with actual-game validation enabled; no repeat import/validation comparison requested. No verified renderer correction. |
| [#123](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/123) Pixel online-menu freezes (closed upstream 12 September 2026) | Historical evidence: Pixel 8 Pro/API 37/Mali-G715 reported online-menu stalls, with a 2222.337 ms presentation gap in one build-28 capture and later online-race drops reported on Pixel 8 Pro / 0.4.16 build 65. PR #141's regression passes and its correction is in published Android 63, but the reports never established a single freeze cause. GitHub now records `CLOSED` / `COMPLETED`; retain this row for history and do not treat closure as technical acceptance or assign new work unless reopened with new evidence. |
| [#103](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/103) Android frame drops | Original reporter improved behavior after changing Game Booster+ mode and resolution; controlled comparison remains pending. A separate Retroid Pocket5/Snapdragon865 reporter reports40–45 FPS at 1x/standard profile versus60FPS with higher heat/power in high-performance mode, and Dolphin60FPS at standard. Reporter confirms Android .2 and preview 1 with validation OFF, mainly Original (Retro installed separately). No repeat settings/benchmark requested; exact OS remains unspecified. No parity, thermal comparison or settings fix verified. |
| [#101](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/101) Fill Screen distortion | 16:9/4:3 fallback; paired scene screenshots and technical report requested. Shared projection correction needs reproduction and cross-platform checks. |
| [#100](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/100) external video black with audio | Device/output chain, local-screen behavior and connection-order comparison requested. Mirroring and a dedicated external game view need separate acceptance. Apple and Android external output are accepted priorities; see the [implementation/test plan](EXTERNAL-DISPLAYS.md). |

| [#91](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/91) DSU phone controller | Open experimental feature; tester identified Apple TV 4K 3rd gen and DSUController 3.0.8. Exact tvOS and phone layout requested. No DSU build yet. |
| [#90](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/90) Wiimmfi | Open compatibility feature, no release commitment. Requires matching executable integration and private identity/authentication handling, not just a MAC/host field. |
| [#5](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/5) Mii/Wii Remote | Shipped cursor/Mii work; reporter directed to current ready-made Mac download for remaining experimental Wii Remote/Nunchuk hardware results. |
| [#92](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/92) licensing clarity | Correction already merged in #93; remains open for upstream author's review. No new unanswered follow-up at review time. |

Latest renderer evidence: #104's video shows character corruption in both
vehicle selection and the starting grid, before driving. #102's second device,
Galaxy Tab S7 FE / Adreno 619, also passes all eight synthetic checks. Its
Android 14 / 0.4.10 build logs confirm Retro at 1× / Fill Screen. The latest
session ends after roughly 9 FPS with no captured termination reason; the sole
fatal report is an earlier missing-DVD-root startup, followed by successful
game loads. The tablet reporter subsequently completed a race at 4:3 after
also moving the app from microSD to internal storage. Both changed, so neither
is established as the cause; keep that working setup. These are separate
observations, not one established GPU bug.

[#120](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/120) adds a OnePlus
OPD2514 / Android 16 / build 21 / Retro 6.12.7 report with large stretched
surfaces obscuring the race. Reinstalling and clearing caches did not help.
The exact GPU/driver is not inferred from the device name.

The [Android 0.4.12-android.2 diagnostic beta](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/releases/tag/v0.4.12-android.2)
adds opt-in validation/bounds protection for the actual game renderer and
bounded OS exit history. It also fixes the Android system bars remaining visible
during play ([#119](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/119)); local
release-emulator checks cover launch, menu return, Home/resume and transient
edge swipes. The AYN Thor reporter in #128 says system bars still remain visible on build 23; display, affected bars and launch/resume behavior are requested. Device-wide resolution is not established. Normal mode keeps the
previous renderer toggles.
Local host/emulator checks pass; affected Adreno testing and a failing game
draw remain open. This is an Android diagnostic, not a macOS/iPadOS fix.

## macOS contribution under local review

[#112](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/pull/112) proposes controller
assignment/profiles, trigger bindings, native settings and menu integration.
The revised contributor head `271fdc1` includes the trigger correction and
a narrower controller layout. The full dual runtime rebuilds and audits, the
200-case trigger/profile checks pass, and the right-hand controls fit in the
actual native window. A local Apple Silicon candidate (0.4.12/build 27) is
available. It is **not approved**: physical controller/race acceptance remains open. A portable contributor guide
is prepared on the maintainer review branch. See the [local review record](artifacts/2026-09-08/macos-pr112-review.md)
for exact source and acceptance limits.

The targeted Android pass prioritizes measured steady-state CPU costs and an
actual failing character draw, with the existing alarm candidate ready for a
separate online-stall comparison. Keep macOS controller acceptance with its
current owner. #105 has already confirmed the offline rating-transfer test;
Mii migration and server synchronization remain separate. Ratings are loaded
into memory and synchronized by network code, so live file replacement is not
an accepted sync workflow. Android character rendering needs an actual
failing draw reproduction; synthetic passes are insufficient. Performance and
external-display reports still need their requested comparisons. DSU and
Wiimmfi remain independent feature work, not bugs blocked solely on logs.

Profile-aware save management, reusable network-controller input, and any
shared projection/service fixes need platform-specific UI and acceptance work.
An Android picker or a tvOS prototype does not establish parity across hosts.

## Latest macOS PR source boundary

The contributor's physical controller results apply to `271fdc1`, Original only.
Current PR #112 head `a332264` incorporates the later capture/layout corrections;
independent source review and the exact-head native profile harness cleared
those findings. GitHub review status must be reconciled with the latest head.
An integrated candidate still needs actual AppKit/layout/controller and
Original/Retro acceptance. The latest public Mac 34 excludes PR #112. Use the
[board](MAINTENANCE-BOARD.md) for the current owner and candidate, not older commits.

## Resolved related report

[#94](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/94) is closed: the console-serial
correction is distributed on every platform, and the upstream reporter confirmed
server-history cleanup on 8 September. Persistent login failures or an unavailable
original IP need service-admin help, not identity resets.

## macOS screen tearing and V-Sync control report

On 10 September, Christopher relayed a report of screen tearing and no V-Sync
option in the macOS build. This is not yet reproduced; the affected version,
display/refresh rate and window mode are unspecified. The absence of an exposed
option does not establish that presentation synchronization is disabled.

Queued investigation: inspect the current presentation mode and settings UI,
then reproduce the reported scene and distinguish tearing from uneven frame
pacing before deciding whether a correction or user-facing control is needed.
This is separate from PR #157's split-screen interpolation defect. Android,
iPhone/iPad and tvOS applicability has not been evaluated. No fix or build is
claimed. No matching issue title/body was found in the GitHub issue search at
recording time; this entry preserves the owner-relayed report.
