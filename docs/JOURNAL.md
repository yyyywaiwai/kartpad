## 2026-08-28 — G0 workspace initialization

- Goal: establish the workspace and evidence system before modifying or translating private game data.
- State inspected: repository contains only the approved PRD/goal loop in `docs/`, a user-owned WBFS in `ref/`, and a complete local SunPad reference checkout in `ref/sunpad/`. The Git history contains the two documents at the repository root; their move into `docs/` was already present in the working tree and is preserved.
- Host: Apple Silicon arm64, 24 GiB memory, Xcode 26.6 (17F113), macOS SDK 26.5.
- Process state: no booted Simulator and no stale KartPad, WiiCompiled, Dolphin, or test-server process observed.
- Capacity: approximately 21 GiB free at session start. This is a near-term build-capacity risk and must be rechecked before dependency expansion or large generated graphs.
- Smallest step: add private/generated/build/reference exclusions and create the mandated evidence/status files.
- Immediate test: run repository safety inspection and verify the WBFS and local reference checkout are ignored before the first commit.
- Known-good source revision: `7875e82` (`origin/main`), documentation only.
- Next step: identify and hash the supplied disc without modifying it; pin WiiCompiled and reference revisions within available storage.

### G0/G1 result update

- Result: Pass for the initial workspace boundary and input-identification step.
- Disc container: WBFS, 2,778,726,400 bytes, modification time `2026-08-28T14:05:10-0500`.
- Embedded disc identity: `RMCP01`, Mario Kart Wii, PAL, maker `01`, revision 0, Wii magic `0x5d1c9ea3`.
- SHA-1: `73b83ac9b7e4a426de82fdc0a81b6131cc1c7975`.
- SHA-256: `fc035e60610842da6860d23d4a30c1f1c0f019d492469deb8a2ac25ef5822331`.
- Preservation: original WBFS mode changed from `-rw-r--r--` to read-only `-r--r--r--`; filename and contents were not altered.
- WiiCompiled: exact commit `1912292c804ff9b1b79938de89369ec4496f9fff`, tree `34f9deda094915e12f47316059911b28c6812964`, detached checkout, push disabled.
- SunPad reference: clean commit `e43f0ea6b797e5110787171957c9dc3c6213269c`, push disabled.
- Immediate test: hashes completed, header was inspected from the first WBFS disc sector, required paths resolve through `.gitignore`, and the repository safety script is the checkpoint gate.
- Next step: checkpoint G0, then inspect WiiCompiled and pin the remainder of the reference graph for G1.

## 2026-08-28 — G2 translator baseline attempt 1

- Goal: G2 baseline oracle, no-game-data translator suite.
- Target/profile: pinned WiiCompiled translator, host arm64 macOS, Release.
- Commit/build manifest: WiiCompiled `1912292c804ff9b1b79938de89369ec4496f9fff`; no build produced.
- Command: `dotnet test translator/tests/Translator.Tests/Translator.Tests.csproj -c Release` with a TRX evidence logger.
- Expected: restore/build and execute the no-game-data translator test suite.
- Actual: command exited 127 before restore because `dotnet` is not installed.
- First failing subsystem: host prerequisite.
- Primary error: `zsh: command not found: dotnet`.
- Reproduction rate: 1/1; not repeated unchanged.
- Evidence path: terminal result only; no TRX was produced.
- Variables changed since last known good: first translator test attempt.
- Classification: Blocked—local prerequisite, immediately actionable under standing authorization.
- Next step: install the required .NET 8 SDK, record its version, and rerun once.

### G2 translator baseline result

- Change: installed Homebrew `dotnet@8` SDK 8.0.130; invoked it by explicit keg path.
- Immediate test: pinned WiiCompiled `Translator.Tests` Release suite on native arm64.
- Result: Pass — 570 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 570 total.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/wii-compiled-translator-tests.trx`.
- Conclusion: the no-game-data translator suite is green at the pin. This does not establish runtime, game, ARM semantic, or gameplay correctness.
- Next step: finish G1 reference verification and begin the Dolphin behavioral oracle and host portability inventory.

## 2026-08-28 — G1 reference graph and branding track

- Goal: verify required source pins/licenses and complete the independent original-icon task.
- Source result: WheelWizard, rr-pulsar, Retro Rewind wfc-server, wfc-patcher-wii, and Dolphin pinned at immutable commits/trees recorded in `dependencies.lock.json`; every origin push URL is disabled.
- Recovery note: Homebrew Git 2.41 produced a broken partial Dolphin checkout with absent promised blobs. A second partial repair remained invalid, so the failure was escalated to a clean Apple Git 2.50.1 shallow checkout without filters. The clean Dolphin checkout passes connectivity and is the only accepted oracle path; the failed disposable clone is retained ignored as `ref/upstream/dolphin-partial-broken` pending safe cleanup.
- Licensing result: WiiCompiled/WheelWizard/rr-pulsar/SunPad GPLv3; wfc-server AGPLv3; wfc-patcher custom BSD-style attribution or GPLv2+ election; Dolphin aggregate GPLv3-compatible with per-file SPDX; vendored Aurora MIT.
- Icon result: original AI concept generated with OpenAI's built-in image tool, followed by a hand-authored editable SVG master and dark/tinted variants. The first ImageMagick SVG render failed visual QA because strokes collapsed; librsvg replaced that renderer. Corrected 1024 and 16 px outputs were visually inspected and are opaque.
- Icon master SHA-256: `33286f3e27b2eddc9d169d533f8d6f52a7013bd3d8787744941ab4204dbd5c6d`.
- Icon evidence/source: `branding/`, with exact prompt boundary and concept hash in `branding/PROVENANCE.md`.
- Next step: run full `verify-sources.sh`, update G1 status, and checkpoint to GitHub.

### G1 verification result

- Command: `KARTPAD_VERIFY_FULL_DISC=1 ./scripts/verify-sources.sh`.
- Result: Pass. All seven Git references matched their locked commit/tree, were clean, and had disabled push URLs. The WBFS remained read-only, retained its expected size/header/revision, and matched the full locked SHA-256.
- Classification: G1 Pass.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G2 baseline oracle. Capture a pinned Dolphin boot/title/menu, Time Trial, staff ghost, Grand Prix, audio, and save/relaunch evidence set where automation and available inputs permit.

## 2026-08-28 — G2 isolated Dolphin gameplay oracle

- Goal: establish a reproducible boot/save/menu/race/ghost behavioral oracle without modifying the supplied WBFS or the user's Dolphin profile.
- Target/profile: Dolphin 5.0-17995, arm64 JIT, Vulkan, HLE, private user directory; clean PAL `RMCP01` revision 0.
- Oracle executable SHA-256: `818bc7f1d344f4cf0a0ac78ee6c72dbf7800f3ad3ceebdc0c91f72aff7de4fe8`.
- Instance discipline: one Dolphin game instance and no KartPad instance. No additional Simulator was launched.
- Input attempt 1: isolated Quartz keyboard configuration. Expected synthesized A input to advance the wrist-strap screen; actual accessibility key events were not visible to Dolphin's polled keyboard backend. Reproduction 2/2. The unchanged approach was stopped.
- Escalation: inspected the pinned Dolphin input implementation and selected its built-in named-pipe controller backend. The private FIFO and mappings remain ignored under `private/oracle/`.
- Input result: Pass. Pipe A advanced wrist strap/title and drove the complete first-run license flow, main menu, Single Player, Time Trials, Luigi Circuit, and staff ghost selection deterministically.
- Save result: Pass. A new `Player` license was created in the isolated user directory. Evidence includes pre-create confirmation and created-license screens.
- Race/ghost result: Pass for the G2 baseline. The official Nin★sato Luigi Circuit staff ghost (`01:29.670`) was identified; a live challenge and deterministic staff replay rendered successfully. After first-shader warmup, the replay repeatedly reported `60 FPS / 60 VPS / 100%`.
- Control-semantics caveat: the exploratory live drive did not establish an unambiguous acceleration/brake mapping, so no completed human-controlled lap or steering-feel claim is made. The deterministic staff replay is the accepted complete-course behavioral reference; a smaller fixture remains required for KartPad input semantics.
- Audio caveat: subjective audio quality was not assessed and remains hands-on.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/dolphin-oracle/README.md` and indexed screenshots in the same directory.
- Cleanup: Dolphin completed its save shutdown. The user's global `WiimoteNew.ini`, `GCPadNew.ini`, and `Dolphin.ini` matched their pre-session SHA-256 values exactly; no restore write was necessary.
- Classification: G2 Pass. The installed binary is labeled a hashed preliminary oracle distinct from the newer pinned Dolphin source checkout.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G3 host portability contract and no-game-data tests.

## 2026-08-28 — G3 host portability boundary

- Goal: compile a host-neutral utility boundary on arm64 macOS without Win32 libraries or x86-only flags while leaving the pinned Windows baseline untouched.
- Smallest implementation: explicit CMake capability switches and a `kartpad_host` library for monotonic time/deadline sleep, thread naming, application/cache/temp paths, directory creation, and durable atomic replacement.
- Separation: Darwin and Windows implementations are separate translation units selected by the target graph. Public headers contain standard C++ types only.
- Immediate test: `./scripts/test-host-portability.sh` with AppleClang 21.0.0, Ninja, arm64, deployment target 14.0, RelWithDebInfo.
- Result: Pass — host library and contract executable compiled/linked, CTest 1/1 passed, and the generated Darwin graph contained none of the forbidden Win32 libraries or `-march=x86-64`.
- Contract assertions: capability selection, monotonic advance, non-early deadline sleep, thread-name round trip, standard macOS path domains, first/replacement atomic writes, and no temporary sibling leakage.
- Build evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g3-host-portability-build-manifest.json`.
- Windows baseline: pinned WiiCompiled checkout remained clean at commit `1912292c804ff9b1b79938de89369ec4496f9fff`, tree `34f9deda094915e12f47316059911b28c6812964`; no upstream file was edited.
- Inventory: reproducible search script and source-complete first-party ownership table recorded in `docs/PORTABILITY.md`.
- Classification: G3 Pass. A Windows execution result is not claimed; its baseline source graph remains isolated and reproducible at the pin.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G4 Darwin guest-memory model, beginning with the checked oracle and scalar/endian/alias contract fixtures.

## 2026-08-28 — G4 checked guest memory and Darwin reservation probe

- Goal: select and prove a safe macOS guest-memory path before scheduler or full runtime bring-up.
- Selected path: checked/table memory, preserving the full 32-bit guest address domain sparsely and using shared backing IDs for guest aliases.
- Immediate command: `./scripts/test-guest-memory.sh`.
- Release result: Pass. Signed/unsigned scalar widths, every alignment, endian layout, cross-page access, boundary/domain faults, alias coherence, overlap rejection, MMIO dispatch, executable-write guard, fault diagnostics, concurrency, lifecycle, randomized stress, and guest microprogram passed.
- Sanitizer result: Pass under AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer with no finding.
- Stress: four ordered worker threads plus 100,000 seeded random 64-bit writes/reads and full retained-state verification.
- Diagnostics: a failing access carries the translated function, guest PC, guest LR, and register dump supplied by the active CPU context provider.
- Microprogram: fetched bytecode from guest memory, performed a big-endian store, took a branch, invoked a host-call fixture, and halted with the expected result.
- Flat candidate probe: non-overwriting fixed reservation of 4 GiB plus guard at 16 TiB succeeded, as did protect/deallocate and a two-launch base-relative lifecycle. No destructive fixed overwrite flag was used.
- Decision: G4 Pass on the checked backend. Mach VM flat memory remains an optimization experiment until alias/protection/fault/differential evidence matches the checked oracle.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g4-guest-memory.md`.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G5 portable guest scheduler/context backend.

## 2026-08-28 — G5 explicit portable guest scheduler

- Goal: replace the Windows-fiber dependency with a deterministic arm64-safe guest execution contract.
- Strategy: explicit cooperative state machine. A translated step owns no persistent host stack; it returns yield, sleep, queue-wait, join-wait, or exit. Each guest thread stores a complete CPU context.
- Lock boundary: the scheduler selects/updates metadata under its mutex, releases it for guest/host/retrace callbacks, then applies the returned action. A nested callback inspection test passes.
- Immediate command: `./scripts/test-guest-scheduler.sh`.
- Lifecycle result: create suspended, resume, priority order, yield, sleep/alarm, simultaneous wake, queue, join, cancel, exit, 10,000 create/reap cycles, background suspension, idle/deadlock return, and shutdown while waiting/running all pass.
- Context result: GPRs, PC/LR/CR, FPSCR, every FP register bit pattern including NaN payloads, and 128 bytes of SIMD state persist across switches.
- Determinism result: two independent 1,000,000-operation runs distributed exactly 250,000 steps to each of four peers, emitted exactly 10,000 VI callbacks, and produced identical state hash `0x7287563387fb1677`.
- Sanitizer result: Pass under ASan/UBSan with no finding.
- Classification: G5 Pass for the backend contract. Wii OS HLE/translated-boundary integration is G6; physical mobile backgrounding remains a later device test.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g5-guest-scheduler.md`.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G6 native renderer/audio/input/storage/network subsystem initialization.

## 2026-08-28 — G6 native Apple subsystem smoke

- Goal: initialize renderer, audio, input, storage, and networking through native macOS APIs before translated-frame work.
- Immediate command: `./scripts/test-native-subsystems.sh` with `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1`.
- Renderer result: Pass. Metal API Validation enabled; Apple M2 device/queue cleared an 8×8 RGBA8 render target, completed normally, and all pixels matched the expected 0.25/0.5/0.75/1.0 color.
- Audio result: Pass for initialization. Apple's default output component instantiated, reported 48 kHz/eight channels, and disposed cleanly. No audible-quality claim is made.
- Input result: Pass for discovery initialization. GameController returned a valid zero-controller collection; physical mapping remains a later row.
- Storage result: Pass through durable atomic replacement and cleanup in the app-specific temporary domain.
- Network result: Pass for host smoke. `localhost` DNS and an actual IPv4 loopback bind/listen/connect/accept/send/receive payload passed.
- Classification: G6 Pass for native synthetic subsystem initialization. Dawn/Aurora surface integration, translated rendering, streaming audio, physical input, TLS, and external services remain gated later.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g6-native-subsystems.md`.
- Next lowest unmet goal: G7 first translated rendered frame through the real application surface/renderer bridge.

## 2026-08-28 — G6 gate correction and semantic differential

- Review correction: the native Apple subsystem smoke was useful preparation but had been mislabeled as G6. `GOAL-LOOP.md` defines G6 as exact PPC/AArch64 semantics. The error was caught before the next checkpoint; G6 was reopened and remains the lowest unmet goal.
- Smallest implementation: a standard-C++ semantics layer, a curated/seeded no-game-data harness built for arm64 and x86_64/Rosetta, and a real pinned-translator DOL microfixture executing integer add plus `fadds` through checked guest memory.
- Oracle: pinned Dolphin `FloatUtils.cpp` is compiled directly and its fres/frsqrte raw bits are compared byte-for-byte with the checked corpus.
- Result: arm64 and x86_64 each completed 250,080 checks with identical state hash `0xca5a9534a8da687b`; arm64 ASan/UBSan passed; translator suite remained 570/570; translated fixture matched on both architectures.
- Failure 1: upward float-to-word vector returned 2 instead of 3. First failing subsystem: guest rounding-mode selection. The optimized ambient-fenv approach was replaced with explicit guest-mode `trunc`/`ceil`/`floor`/nearest selection; changed run passed.
- Failure 2: initial `Force25Bit`, estimate, and wrapped-scale expected values disagreed. The implementations were not changed. Independent source inspection and compiled pinned-Dolphin output showed the hand-entered expectations were wrong; corrected corpora passed.
- Failure 3: sanitizer run exited because macOS ASan reports leak detection unsupported. The changed run disabled only unsupported leak detection; ASan/UBSan passed.
- Classification: In progress. The tested subset is green, but the complete translator-emitted helper surface is not yet portable/proven. Exact inventory and remaining work are in `docs/SEMANTICS.md`.
- Next step: port and test the remaining ISA/helper surface, with translated paired-single/GQR/FPSCR/ABI fixtures.

### Provisional G7 experiment (not gate acceptance)

- A pinned-translator synthetic command function drove a real AppKit/CAMetalLayer drawable with Metal validation and every-pixel comparison. The output is `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g7-translated-frame.png`.
- First build failure: strict CoreGraphics enum/integer bitwise mismatch. Explicit integer conversions fixed it; the changed build and UI run passed.
- Classification: preparatory only. No Dawn/Aurora, GX geometry, or game frame is claimed, and G7 remains gated behind G6.

### G6 paired/GQR/FPSCR expansion

- Added the complete portable paired-single operation family, all five GQR data encodings across paired and W=1 forms, representative wrapped scales, endian/NaN/subnormal rules, and broader randomized architecture differential coverage.
- Expanded the generated DOL itself: pinned translator output now performs real `psq_l`, `ps_add`, `psq_st`, and `fdivs` operations in addition to integer/`fadds`, then routes results through checked guest memory.
- First FPSCR run produced the correct infinity but left FPSCR zero. Root cause: ordinary optimized FP mode did not guarantee host exception observation around the translated expression. Semantic targets now use strict FP mode in addition to no-fast-math/no-contraction; the changed arm64 and x86_64 runs both produce FPSCR `0x84000000` (FX|ZX).
- Result: Pass for the expanded subset — 250,155 checks, identical state hash `0xb332d343c4e3dc81`, translated paired/GQR/flag fixture identical on arm64 and x86_64, sanitizers green, translator 570/570.
- Classification remains In progress pending the stateful helper inventory in `docs/SEMANTICS.md`.

### G6 real Mario Kart Wii translation surface

- Built pinned Wiimms ISO Tools in an ignored disposable copy. First macOS build failed because setup used GNU-only `awk gensub`, leaving the host type unset and adding `-static-libgcc`; the corrected portable `awk gsub` setup identified macOS. Native arm64 linking then rejected legacy unaligned common pointers, so the changed build targeted x86_64 and ran successfully under Rosetta.
- Extracted only `sys/main.dol` from the read-only supplied WBFS into ignored `private/` data. Its SHA-256 is `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05`, exactly WiiCompiled's pinned PAL DOL.
- Recursive translation from `0x800060A4` with unsupported instructions disabled emitted 10,836 functions. The 29,792-entry pinned map supplied boundaries; 802 functions were reached by the call graph and 10,034 additional valid entries were seeded from the map.
- First whole-surface compile exposed stack/resolved/state PSQ forms, state-free ABI guards, CR/XER helpers, time-base/MSR state, GX FIFO calls, cache-line zero, system calls, and fused negative multiply-subtract not represented by the microfixture. Each changed compile moved past the prior signature; no unchanged failed run was repeated.
- Final strict-FP AppleClang pass syntax-compiled all 10,836 emitted units. The full arm64/x86 semantic suite remained green at 250,155 checks and hash `0xb332d343c4e3dc81`; the stateful translated fixture matched with FPSCR `0xa7000003`; sanitizers, Dolphin oracle, and translator 570/570 passed.
- Classification remains In progress. Whole-title compilation proves portable surface ownership, not exact invalid-subcause/enabled-exception state or callback/scheduler execution.

### G6 translated FPSCR invalid-state lowering

- Replaced generic host `FE_INVALID` attribution for basic scalar add/subtract/multiply/divide/sqrt with explicit Broadway causes: VXSNAN, VXISI, VXIDI, VXZDZ, VXIMZ, VXSQRT, and ZX. FX/VX/FEX summaries and FPRF classification are updated from guest state.
- A value-only emitted expression could not represent enabled-exception write suppression. KartPad now applies a tracked patch to an ignored disposable WiiCompiled copy; scalar helpers receive the destination by reference and leave it unchanged when VE or ZE enables the raised cause. The pinned checkout remains clean and push-disabled.
- The first patched translator build failed because two former local emitters became unused under warnings-as-errors. Removing those obsolete local functions produced a clean build. The original upstream tests then reported 22 intentional shape mismatches; adjusting the disposable patch's expectations and adding `PPC_Fsqrts` coverage produced 571/571.
- The first translated invalid fixture reported zeros because its checked-memory harness initialized only the older 28-byte data section. Adding +infinity, -infinity, and 42.0 to the harness made the changed run prove canonical invalid NaN with VE disabled, then preservation of 42.0 with VE enabled.
- Result: arm64/x86_64 each pass 250,188 checks with identical hash `0x09ff7940379dd04a`; ASan/UBSan, Dolphin oracle, patched translator 571/571, and the translated suppression fixture pass. All 10,836 real-title units regenerate and syntax-compile with the patched translator.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Next smallest work is fused/conversion/estimate/paired exception state, followed by translated host callbacks and NI scheduler persistence.

### G6 translated float-to-word conversion state

- Routed `fctiw` and `fctiwz` through stateful translated calls instead of unconditional expression assignments. The pure model now emits the PowerPC `0xfff8...` result layout, preserves FPRF, records FI/FR/XX, raises VXCVI and VXSNAN, and suppresses invalid writes under VE.
- Replaced ambient-host nearest rounding with an explicit finite ties-to-even implementation, keeping all four guest rounding modes independent of host fenv state.
- Expanded the generated DOL to translate both conversion instructions and an enabled invalid conversion. Runtime evidence proves truncation of 2.75 to word 2, nearest-even to word 3, and preservation of the original 2.75 destination when converting infinity with VE enabled.
- Result: 250,197 arm64/x86_64 checks match at `0x817dafe156e3268c`; ASan/UBSan and patched translator 573/573 pass; all 10,836 real-title units regenerate and strict-FP syntax-compile.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Fused, estimate, paired-lane exception aggregation, callback execution, and NI scheduler persistence remain.

### G6 translated fused invalid state

- Replaced all eight scalar fused helper emissions (`fmadd`, `fmsub`, `fnmadd`, `fnmsub` and single variants) with destination-by-reference stateful calls. The model preserves PowerPC NaN operand priority (a, b, c), distinguishes invalid product VXIMZ from invalid add VXISI, preserves NaN sign behavior for negative forms, updates FPRF, and suppresses the destination under VE.
- First patched translator build failed because the last value-only scalar helper builder became unused under warnings-as-errors; removing it exposed one intentional operand-order assertion, which was updated to require the stateful destination-first shape. The changed suite passes 577/577.
- Expanded the translated DOL with invalid `fmadds` under VE. The runtime keeps the destination at 42.0 while setting VXIMZ; arm64/x86_64 and ASan/UBSan agree.
- Result: 250,202 checks, identical hash `0x8947f7ff3d2e35f4`, translated final FPSCR `0xe7911183`, and all 10,836 real-title units regenerate and strict-FP syntax-compile.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Estimate/paired exception aggregation, callbacks, and NI scheduler persistence remain.

### G6 translated scalar-estimate state

- Routed `fres` and `frsqrte` through stateful lowering while retaining the compiled-Dolphin bit-exact estimate algorithms. The model now raises ZX for reciprocal zero, VXSQRT for negative reciprocal-square-root, and VXSNAN for signaling NaNs, while updating summaries/FPRF and clearing FI/FR on exceptional results.
- Expanded the translated DOL with zero `fres` under ZE and negative `frsqrte` under VE. Both destinations remain 42.0 while ZE and VXSQRT become sticky; direct contracts also cover their disabled-enable results and signaling-NaN payload behavior.
- Regenerated the tracked translator patch as a zero-context diff and made its disposable-copy preparation explicitly apply zero-context patches; the immutable pinned checkout remains untouched.
- Result: 250,208 checks, identical arm64/x86_64 hash `0x6ca6a115ecbe463e`, translated final FPSCR `0xe7911393`, ASan/UBSan Pass, patched translator 579/579, and all 10,836 real-title units regenerate and strict-FP syntax-compile.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Paired-lane exception aggregation, callbacks, and NI scheduler persistence remain.

### G6 translated paired-estimate state

- Added raw-float signaling-NaN classification and a paired-estimate state result that aggregates ZX, VXSQRT, and VXSNAN across both lanes, clears FI/FR on exceptional inputs, applies NI rounding, and derives FPRF from PS0.
- Updated the existing `PPC_PsRes` and `PPC_PsRsqrte` runtime helpers without changing their translator ABI. Unlike scalar enabled exceptions, paired estimates retain the hardware behavior of always writing both lanes under VE/ZE.
- Expanded the translated DOL with `{0,+inf}` `ps_res` and `{1.5,-2}` `ps_rsqrte`; runtime evidence proves the results, sticky cross-lane causes, and final PS0 classification.
- Result: 250,214 checks, identical arm64/x86_64 hash `0x1f462e0cd4bbd7cb`, translated final FPSCR `0xe7904393`, ASan/UBSan Pass, patched translator 579/579, and all 10,836 real-title units strict-FP syntax-compile.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Paired arithmetic/fused exception aggregation, exact comparisons, callbacks, and NI scheduler persistence remain.

### G6 exact translated comparisons

- Added an exact comparison result model: CR/FPCC unordered for NaNs, VXSNAN for signaling NaNs, ordered VXVC for qNaN, and the Broadway rule that ordered sNaN omits VXVC when VE is enabled.
- Preserved scalar `fcmpo` versus `fcmpu` in the existing compare IR and made scalar/paired code generation update FPSCR before CR. Float compares are no longer removed or branch-fused because their FPSCR side effects are architecturally observable.
- Straight-line compare fixtures exposed legitimate fallthrough labels that Clang diagnosed as unused under `-Werror`; generated local labels are now explicitly `[[maybe_unused]]`, and every one of the 10,836 title units still strict-FP syntax-compiles.
- Result: 250,220 checks, identical arm64/x86_64 hash `0x5a58605df18e5d1e`, translated final FPSCR `0xe7981393`, ASan/UBSan Pass, and patched translator 579/579.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Paired arithmetic/fused exception aggregation, callbacks, and NI scheduler persistence remain.

### G6 paired arithmetic exception aggregation

- Routed every paired add/sub/mul/div, fused/negative-fused, splat multiply/add, and sum inline through shared state results. Both lane exceptions accumulate with original enables restored, results always write like Broadway paired instructions, NI rounding applies per lane, and FPRF follows the hardware-selected result lane.
- Added direct state checks for VE-enabled invalid add, ZE-enabled divide-by-zero, and fused VXIMZ with a finite second lane. Expanded the translated DOL with `ps_add` of `{+inf,-inf}` and its negation under VE; both canonical NaN lanes are written and VXISI becomes sticky.
- Result: 250,227 checks, identical arm64/x86_64 hash `0xccd5757c4c0643d4`, translated final FPSCR `0xe7991393`, ASan/UBSan Pass, patched translator 579/579, and all 10,836 title units strict-FP syntax-compile.
- Classification: G6 remains In progress. Translated callback execution and NI scheduler persistence are the next semantic-boundary work.

### G6 translated scheduler/callback boundary and gate pass

- Added a production scheduled-execution bridge that copies every persisted guest CPU field into `CpuContext`, establishes `CpuContextScope`, runs translated/host code with the scheduler lock released, clears the thread-local scope, and commits the complete context before yielding.
- Extended `GuestCpuContext` through CTR/XER/GQR/system/time-base state. A two-step scheduler fixture enables VE, performs a suppressed translated invalid add, yields, verifies NI/VXISI, enables ZE, performs suppressed reciprocal zero, and exits with NI/VE/ZE/VXISI/ZX plus the original destination intact. Nested host code observes the active context; code outside the callback observes none.
- Release and ASan/UBSan scheduler suites pass with the unchanged million-operation hash `0x7287563387fb1677`. The G7 translated-frame dispatcher now establishes the same scope and its app target builds cleanly.
- G6 classification: **Pass**. The 250,227-check arm64/x86_64 differential hash is `0xccd5757c4c0643d4`; Dolphin estimates, sanitizers, patched translator 579/579, translated semantic execution, scheduled persistence, and the complete 10,836-unit PAL title surface have zero unexplained mismatches. G7 becomes the lowest unmet goal.

### G7 pinned Aurora/Dawn Metal host frame

- Resolved Aurora's declared Dawn `v20260603.191052` Darwin arm64 archive to SHA-256 `084ffd2ef500d614e443e3d494738272134628867bad3270d67ee8b0fb5f0838` and added configure-time hash enforcement.
- Built the immutable WiiCompiled-vendored Aurora source with GX enabled and Dawn's Metal backend, then linked it into the KartPad graph through public Aurora targets.
- The finite host fixture selected `BACKEND_METAL`; Dawn reported the Apple M2 Metal adapter, BGRA8 surface, and Immediate presentation mode.
- Aurora's GPU readback captured the frame-2 `GXSetCopyClear` result at 1164x960. Both captured corners are exact BGRA `56 34 12 ff`; BMP SHA-256 is `8881f050f2df9a16ce38565f8a33830fdf649a5d00268322699a7cd06e218596`.
- Host-frame portion: **Pass**. G7 remains in progress pending translated GX geometry and the first game frame.

### G7 translated GX geometry

- Expanded the generated PowerPC fixture from a four-word direct-Metal clear command to a versioned 64-byte `KPGX` payload containing a clear color and three XYZ vertices. Exact pinned-translator regeneration is required by the test.
- The translated function executes within `CpuContextScope` and writes through checked guest memory. Resolved-range stores retain address-by-address checked semantics in the fixture backend instead of exposing raw backing pointers.
- The native bridge validates the command and issues real Dolphin GX projection, matrix, vertex-format, TEV, and triangle commands. Aurora decodes the FIFO, builds the GX pipeline, Dawn submits it to Metal, and Aurora captures the presentation texture.
- The logical 640x480 GX viewport maps to the 1164x960 Retina EFB. The captured corners are exact clear BGRA `30 20 10 ff`, while the center is exact triangle BGRA `00 00 00 ff`; BMP SHA-256 is `799af319cb7bdbbc3ce6371b00d3dad1a5c47a8a14c6108f2271b0210777477e`.
- Translated-GX portion: **Pass**. The first Mario Kart Wii frame is the remaining G7 condition.

### G7 real Mario Kart Wii frame and gate pass

- Extracted the user-owned PAL WBFS into ignored private data with `nodtool 2.0.0-alpha.9`. Hash validation rejected the container at H0 block 0, so the extraction was repeated without validation; the resulting `main.dol` SHA-256 still exactly matches the independently verified input DOL.
- Ported WiiCompiled's flat 4 GiB guest mapping and cooperative `OSThread` fibers to Apple arm64. The scheduler now uses `ucontext` host fibers and preserves the existing per-thread `CpuContext`, FPSCR/NI, wait, wake, resume, termination, and deferred-delete semantics.
- Linked all 10,264 shared translated functions, initialized Revolution OS, published 2,068 FST entries from 2,037 disc files, initialized GX/VI, and entered the real game frame loop. A live sample captured `EGG::AsyncDisplay::endRender → GXCopyDisp` on the main stack and VI-retrace sleep/resume on a guest fiber.
- Packaged the ignored spike as a signed portable macOS app for GUI playtesting. Computer Use captured the Nintendo wrist-strap safety screen at 60 FPS through Aurora, pinned Dawn, and Metal. Capture SHA-256 is `3228b6044cfc746e4bf86971f1445f412e5e8a6ff3029fa8b3b620d20be087b8`.
- Added a reproducible Apple runtime patch and preparation script. Private disc, NAND, translation, caches, and application products remain ignored.
- G7 classification: **Pass**. G8 is the lowest unmet goal: advance through intro/title/menu, verify audible audio, and prove keyboard/controller navigation.

## 2026-08-28 — G8 full title graph, audio, and controller navigation

- Goal: boot the native macOS build through intro/title/menu with audible audio and working navigation.
- Translation: generated the complete PAL DOL+`StaticR.rel` graph from the user-owned disc extraction. The graph contains 29,637 translated functions; 29,065 are shared base functions and the StaticR prolog `0x8055531C` is present.
- Build failure signature: the first full shard failed on undeclared `Ppc*StateInline` helpers. Cause: KartPad's FPSCR-aware translator patch emitted the exact stateful ABI proven at G6, while the production shell still exposed older value-only helpers. The production header now adapts generated calls to KartPad's tested header-only semantic model under C++20. The changed 72-shard build linked successfully.
- Runtime result: Pass. The app loaded 4,934,832 bytes of StaticR at `0x805102E0`, ran 43 DOL and 192 REL constructors, rendered the Wii/Mario Kart intros and title, and reached Select License at 60 FPS through Metal.
- Input failure 1: title ignored the existing GameCube keyboard mapping. Trace showed the Wii KPAD HLE returned no data and WPAD declared channel 0 disconnected. Implemented a big-endian core KPAD report and connected channel-0 WPAD contract.
- Input failure 2: short Computer Use key taps were occasionally invisible to `SDL_GetKeyboardState` between guest polls. An SDL event watch now latches key-down edges until the next KPAD sample. Changed run passed: Return advanced title, Right selected Options, Left+Return opened New License, and Q/Wii Remote 1 returned.
- Audio result: Pass for G8 audibility. SDL opened 32 kHz stereo at gain 1 and received non-silent PCM (peak 3988, queue 6,372 bytes). Independent AVFoundation capture of the active system-output device measured 427,776 samples over 4.46 seconds, mean `-36.2 dB`, peak `-17.6 dB`. The temporary WAV is not retained.
- Instance discipline: no Simulator and exactly one game instance. Every rebuild followed a Computer Use close and PID check before replacement/relaunch.
- Reproducibility: `scripts/generate-g8-full-title.sh`, the refreshed `patches/wiicompiled-apple-runtime.patch`, and `scripts/prepare-g7-game-runtime.sh` capture translation/runtime preparation without publishing game data.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g8-title-menu/`.
- G8 classification: **Pass**. G9 is the lowest unmet goal: create an isolated license, complete a race/results/menu cycle, save, quit/relaunch, and run the staff-ghost fixture.

## 2026-08-28 — G9 first macOS race, save, and staff ghost

- Created an isolated `Player` license in the portable app NAND and preserved ignored 17-file pre-license and post-license backups.
- Initial race playtesting proved sustained Wii Remote acceleration but exposed the lack of reliable steering. Controller work was reduced against Mario Kart's byte-matching decomp headers: its historical `KPADStatus` is `0x84`, `KPADUnifiedWpadStatus` is `0x38`, and the Classic format byte is at `0x36`. The newer public SDK layout used during the first experiment was incompatible.
- Implemented the exact Classic report in both KPAD paths. The live UI changed its back glyph to Classic `B`; Return/A accelerated, A/D changed native left-stick steering, and Q/B reversed. SDL event-held taps are bounded to 500 ms and keyboard stick magnitude is scaled to 0.35 for GUI control.
- Completed a 100cc Luigi Circuit VS session through standings, the `Next Race / Quit` result menu, and Main Menu. The GUI-driven kart timed out in 12th with 0 points; this is recorded as a playtest-quality limitation, not misrepresented as a winning player run.
- Save evidence: the 2,867,200-byte `rksys.dat` changed from post-license SHA-256 `5291cecd0ae1749a7996dfd8f3bc53978a9af08fe9aaf639a831214d6bb24f42` to post-race `1e7b6a9482d01436bf5fb650528191f8b725d1a74c178bad30ccae2d10cdc529`.
- Quit the only running instance, relaunched the signed portable app, and verified `Player` remained available while the save retained the post-race hash.
- Opened the original Luigi Circuit `Nin★sato` staff ghost (`01:29.670`) and ran its replay at 60 FPS. No Simulator was booted.
- Reproducibility: refreshed `patches/wiicompiled-apple-runtime.patch` dry-runs cleanly against the pinned runtime. Exact Classic input checkpoint `d59218f` is on GitHub.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g9-race-save/`.
- G9 classification: **Pass**. G10 is the lowest unmet goal: complete the mandatory macOS offline compatibility matrix and close the player-lap precision limitation.

## 2026-08-28 — G10 RKG structural oracle and player-fixture investigation

- Goal: establish a deterministic, locally inspectable staff-ghost input oracle before expanding the offline matrix.
- Corrected the RKG sequence-duration rule against the game's translated `KPad*ButtonsStream::readFrame`: a stored duration is `max(1, value)`, not `value + 1`. All 64 on-disc staff files now parse with equal face/direction/trick totals; the parser emits structural metadata only.
- Added a reproducible, opt-in guard to the translated PAL `KPadWiiController::calcInner` at `0x8051FC84`. With no configured/armed fixture it returns to the complete original function.
- Two identical startup crashes from an earlier duplicate native override were classified and removed. The guarded translated function then booted normally.
- A bounded probe of the game's own `KPadGhostController` proved that input begins on race stage 1 and stage 1 contains exactly 240 calls. The player fixture independently reported `stage=1 frame=0` and `stage=2 frame=240`.
- Native output verified the first direction expansion directly: `0x8e` for four calls before the next sequence. The corrected decoder matches it.
- Configuration errors were separately falsified: Luigi Circuit regular staff vehicle ID `0x10` is Sprinter, not Standard Kart M, and is locked on the fresh license. Later tests used selectable Shell Cup staff configurations and verified each character/vehicle label in the live UI.
- The regular N64 Mario Raceway file (`Baby Mario`, PAL `Nanobike`/Bit Bike, Manual) followed the racing line through a complete first lap and entered lap 2, then diverged later. The countdown cadence remained exact. Forcing the Wii slot's control-source field to `GHOST` raised the expected controller-interrupted dialog and was reverted.
- Classification: **Inconclusive diagnostic, not Pass.** The player-injection harness is not the native ghost product path and does not satisfy a G10 row. The native Luigi Circuit staff replay established in G9 remains healthy.
- Reproducibility: refreshed `patches/wiicompiled-apple-runtime.patch` dry-runs against the pinned runtime; `scripts/inspect-mkw-rkg.py --self-test` and the repository safety audit pass.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g10-offline/`.
- Next step: run independent native G10 rows—original tracks/cups, Grand Prix/VS/Battle/Time Trial, local multiplayer, controller slots, audio, and save behavior—while retaining the fixture only as a diagnostic tool.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 native N64 Mario Raceway ghost divergence

- Ran the final signed native arm64 product path with no configured RKG fixture and no player injection. Through the original Time Trials UI, selected Shell Cup → N64 Mario Raceway → regular staff ghost `Nin★Ichiro 02:14.799` → Watch Replay.
- Native result: **Fail.** The replay began on the expected line at 59.7–59.9 FPS, later moved off course, and was still running well beyond the recorded `02:14.799` duration. This is the game's own `KPadGhostController` path, so it falsifies the earlier working assumption that divergence was confined to the diagnostic live-player injector.
- Oracle comparison: launched the exact pinned Dolphin 5.0-17995 with an isolated user directory and the same read-only WBFS. The identical ghost held 60 FPS/VPS at 100%, stayed on the racing line at the recorded checkpoints, completed, and automatically restarted its replay loop.
- Classification: genuine P1 G10 native translated-runtime determinism defect. The comparison isolates the execution runtime from the WBFS, staff file, and expected finish behavior, but does not yet attribute the cause to PPC semantics, scheduler timing, HLE state, or physics integration. G6 is not reopened without that attribution.
- Reproduction count: native failure 1/1; pinned-Dolphin pass 1/1. The next run must add bounded state tracing rather than repeat the unchanged visual test.
- Instance discipline: exactly one game process ran at a time. KartPad was closed before Dolphin launched; Dolphin emulation was stopped before its app closed. The isolated controller's temporary `Always Connected` option was restored to off. No Simulator was booted.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g10-native-n64-mario/`.
- Next step: capture a deterministic native per-frame kart/physics state trace and locate the earliest divergent state transition against a known-good execution.

### Correction — full-frame comparison disproved the visual failure

- Added a read-only, opt-in native frame-end trace covering position, external/internal velocity, main rotation, internal speed, movement direction, race stage, and race timer. No controller or guest state was modified.
- The native run completed race stage 2 at timer transition `8319 → 8320`, entered finish stage 4, returned to stage 0, and began another replay. Its longest race segment is `240..8319`, exactly 8,080 frames; the initial wall-clock observation had crossed into the automatic second loop.
- Captured the same guest addresses using pinned Dolphin's built-in frame-end MemoryWatcher. Dolphin produced the identical `240..8319` segment.
- `scripts/compare-mkw-state-traces.py` compared 17 raw state words at every common frame: 8,080 frames, 137,360 word comparisons, **zero mismatches**.
- Corrected classification: **Pass.** The earlier P1 entry above is retained as an audit trail but is superseded. There is no observed native N64 Mario staff-replay divergence and no basis to reopen G6.
- During Dolphin controller recovery, a stopped Dolphin frontend remained open when a new emulation process started. The PID check caught and closed that frontend before play continued; only one game emulation was active. The isolated `Always Connected` option was restored to off, all Dolphin/KartPad processes were closed, and no Simulator was booted.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-28/g10-native-n64-mario/state-trace-comparison.txt`.
- Next step: resume the independent G10 offline compatibility matrix. Visual elapsed-time inference is no longer an accepted ghost-timing oracle.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 representative Balloon Battle

- Ran the normal signed arm64 product path with no diagnostic environment and selected Single Player → Battle → Balloon Battle → Block Plaza.
- Configuration: 6-v-6 teams, Mario, Standard Kart M, Manual drift. Block Plaza loaded through its arena intro and the three-minute match ran to completion with all 12 racers.
- Observed active scoring, minimap state, AI movement, item effects, ink, balloon loss, acceleration, steering, and player position change. Final team score was red 9, blue 13.
- Result flow passed: the complete result table appeared, followed by `Next Battle / Quit`; Quit returned cleanly to Main Menu.
- Renderer labels around GUI interaction/capture ranged from 43.2 to 60.0 FPS. This is recorded, not rounded into a cadence claim; G11 requires its dedicated deterministic performance method.
- Classification: **Partial Pass for PRD row 27.** The required representative full Balloon Battle completes. Block Plaza is one of ten arenas proven to boot; the remaining nine arena boots are still required.
- Instance discipline: exactly one KartPad game process, no Dolphin, and no Simulator. The app was closed before documenting the row.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-balloon-battle/`.
- Next step: boot the remaining nine Balloon Battle arenas without repeating the unchanged full-match run.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Balloon Battle all-arena completion

- Continued the same normal signed arm64 product path with no diagnostic environment and no Simulator.
- Booted the remaining nine retail Balloon Battle arenas through the normal Single Player UI: Delfino Pier, Funky Stadium, Chain Chomp Roulette, Thwomp Desert, SNES Battle Course 4, GBA Battle Course 3, N64 Skyscraper, GCN Cookie Land, and DS Twilight House.
- Each arena reached its intro or active-match presentation with environment, HUD, player kart, and opponents visible. Each boot-only check exited through Pause → Quit and returned cleanly to Main Menu before the next selection.
- Together with the completed Block Plaza match, this covers all ten retail arenas and the representative full-match requirement.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 27.** No second full match is required without a changed variable.
- Instance discipline: exactly one KartPad process throughout, no Dolphin, and no Simulator.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-balloon-battle/`.
- Next step: continue the lowest unmet G10 compatibility rows outside Balloon Battle.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Coin Runners all-arena completion

- Ran the normal signed arm64 product path with no diagnostic environment and selected Single Player → Battle → Coin Runners.
- Configuration: 6-v-6 teams, Mario, Standard Kart M, Manual drift. Block Plaza ran through two complete three-minute matches with all 12 racers, changing team totals, individual coin totals, coins, items, AI, minimap activity, acceleration, and steering visible.
- The first match exercised the default next-match path. The second produced a clean full result table: red 40, blue 66, followed by the team outcome and clean return to Main Menu.
- Booted the other nine retail arenas through the normal UI: Delfino Pier, Funky Stadium, Chain Chomp Roulette, Thwomp Desert, SNES Battle Course 4, GBA Battle Course 3, N64 Skyscraper, GCN Cookie Land, and DS Twilight House.
- Each boot-only check reached countdown or active match with the Coin Runners HUD, coins, item boxes, player kart, and opponents visible, then exited through Pause → Quit.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 28.** Every arena boots and the representative full match completes.
- Instance discipline: exactly one KartPad process throughout, no Dolphin, and no booted Simulator.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-coin-runners/`.
- Next step: continue the remaining G10 track/cup/mode/local-multiplayer/controller/audio/save rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 explicit GameCube adapter limitation

- Audited the public Darwin product graph and adapter contract. macOS deliberately selects `src/apple/wup028_adapter_stub.cpp`; discovery/read/rumble report no active adapter and game-port assignments remain unclaimed.
- The product therefore does not advertise or silently attempt WUP-028 raw USB support. `docs/PORTABILITY.md` already identifies a separate macOS backend or explicit limitation as the portability requirement.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 32 by explicit limitation.** A physical adapter pass is not claimed. Ordinary SDL/GameController assignment and reconnect remain separate mandatory rows.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-gamecube-adapter.md`.
- Next step: continue the remaining G10 track/cup/mode/local-multiplayer/ordinary-controller/audio/save rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 four keyboard-backed controller slots

- Root cause: WPAD/KPAD hard-coded channel 0 as the only connected device; channels 1–3 always returned no controller or no samples, blocking local multiplayer.
- Implemented independent keyboard-backed Classic reports for all four channels, per-channel pending/previous state, connection-aware WPAD probe/info/LED/data-format behavior, and explicit P2–P4 connect/disconnect bindings.
- The retail four-player registration UI assigned yellow/P1, blue/P2, red/P3, and green/P4 controllers. P2 independently selected Luigi/Standard Kart M and accelerated/steered in live two-player Luigi Circuit.
- Sent a P3 A edge immediately before disconnect. The game raised the correct red/P3 interruption dialog. Reconnect restored four assignments and remained stable beyond the synthetic hold interval, proving stale held state was cleared.
- Increased keyboard stick magnitude from 0.35 to the full normalized range after the first split-screen driving pass showed insufficient recovery authority off road.
- The signed arm64 product rebuilds and launches; the refreshed public runtime patch dry-runs against the pinned source.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 31.** Full two-player and three/four-player race completion remain rows 29–30 and are not claimed here.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-controller-slots/`.
- Next step: complete the two-player and three/four-player split-screen race rows with the new channel implementation.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 items, AI, and collisions cross-evidence

- Audited the accepted native full-session evidence instead of repeating an unchanged fixture.
- Balloon Battle completed multiple 12-racer matches with active AI, item boxes/effects, Blooper ink, balloon loss, collisions, scoring, minimap activity, results, and clean exits.
- Coin Runners completed two 12-racer matches with coins, items, AI, collisions, changing team/individual totals, results, and clean exit. The Bowser/Automatic changed-variable match added another complete item/collision session.
- The earlier 100cc Luigi Circuit VS run independently completed a 12-racer item/AI race through standings and menu transition.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 25.** Heavy 12-racer item fixtures complete correctly without an observed P0/P1 defect.
- Evidence index: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-items-ai-collisions.md`.
- Next step: continue the remaining G10 track/cup/mode/local-multiplayer/controller/audio/save rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 keyboard fallback race calibration

- A native two-player Luigi Circuit playtest exposed that `Return` must remain a short synthetic pulse for menu safety, which also made it a poor held accelerator during a race. Added `U` as a gameplay A/accelerator alias with the existing 500 ms synthetic hold and `M` as the matching gameplay B/reverse alias; `Return`/`Backspace` retain their short menu behavior.
- Repeated changed runs proved sustained forward acceleration, sustained reverse recovery, independent P2 input, item acquisition, AI traffic, stable 60 FPS presentation, and clean split-screen rendering. The first high-speed runs also showed that full-scale keyboard steering crossed a lane in only a few GUI-generated samples, so the fallback stick magnitude returned to the previously validated `0.35` calibration. Physical/touch analog sources are not changed by this keyboard-only scale.
- The affected runtime target rebuilt and the signed app passed strict code-sign verification after each calibration. These runs are diagnostic input evidence only: no complete two-player results screen was reached, so PRD row 29 remains open.
- Next step: complete the two-player results cycle with the calibrated fallback, then repeat the three/four-player full-race rows before advancing G10.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 representative vehicles, weights, and drift modes

- Completed a three-minute native Balloon Battle as Bowser on Standard Bike L with Automatic drift. The kart accelerated and steered, changed position, collided, received ink/item effects, participated in live scoring with 12 racers, reached the full result table, and returned cleanly to Main Menu.
- Combined that changed-variable run with existing accepted native evidence: Mario on Standard Kart M with Manual drift completed both Battle modes, and the Baby Mario Bit Bike/Nanobike Manual official staff replay completed bit-exactly against Dolphin on N64 Mario Raceway.
- The three configurations cover light/medium/heavy characters, kart and bike vehicle families, and Manual/Automatic drift through completed native sessions.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 24.** This is representative coverage; it does not claim every individual unlock as separately completed.
- Instance discipline: exactly one KartPad process, no Dolphin, and no booted Simulator.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-vehicle-character-drift/` plus the linked accepted G10 evidence directories.
- Next step: continue the remaining G10 track/cup/mode/local-multiplayer/controller/audio/save rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 forced-exit save safety

- Began from the stable Main Menu after the completed Battle matrix and made an ignored local recovery copy of the live 2,867,200-byte `rksys.dat`.
- The live save and recovery copy both hashed to `c5a5108cd3184d4b6e8ca55c4fdd768afd08638c99fcb98695757a5f3a58d1d6`.
- Resolved exactly one KartPad PID (23422), terminated that exact process with `SIGKILL`, and confirmed the live save was still byte-identical immediately afterward.
- Relaunched the signed product normally as exactly one new process (PID 26767). Select License displayed the existing `Player` license and progress grid without a damaged slot or recovery warning.
- The post-relaunch save remained byte-identical to the recovery copy with the same SHA-256.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 20 at a stable Main Menu boundary.** No unrelated save corruption was observed and the application recovered normally.
- No Dolphin and no booted Simulator were present. The ignored recovery copy remains under `private/g10-forced-exit/`.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-forced-exit-save/`.
- Next step: continue the remaining G10 track/cup/mode/local-multiplayer/controller/audio/save rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 two-player completion diagnostics

- Ran repeated native two-player Luigi Circuit fixtures with one KartPad process, no Dolphin, and no booted Simulator. P1 and P2 independently accelerated and steered; stable split-screen rendering, AI traffic, item activity, and 60 FPS presentation remained visible.
- A long parked-player run did not reach results even after the AI field circulated for more than ten minutes. Advancing P1 partway through the opening section did not satisfy the timeout condition, so no completion claim is made.
- Built Wiimm's ISO Tool locally as an ignored x86_64/Rosetta utility and enumerated the read-only WBFS. The disc contains both complete Nintendo staff-ghost sets. Disc-derived RKG files remain private and ignored.
- Tightened the opt-in RKG diagnostic with `KARTPAD_RKG_AUTOSTART=1`: it now arms only when `RaceManager` enters the countdown and leaves menu/intro controller handling untouched. The signed product reached the two-player countdown without the earlier interruption.
- The regular N64 Mario Raceway staff input was matched to Baby Mario, Nanobike, and Manual drift. Its Time Trial line still diverged immediately from the rear/outside VS starting slot, proving the different grid origin is material.
- Investigated the game's retail CPU controller path. Reclassifying local player 0 as CPU before and after the menu-to-race scenario copy each produced a reproducible scene-transition `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`; the entire CPU-player experiment was removed, the environment was cleared, and the stable full-title product was rebuilt and strictly code-sign verified.
- Classification: **Diagnostic only.** PRD row 29 remains open because no two-player standings/result cycle has completed.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-two-player-race/`.
- Next step: pursue a normal retail completion path that preserves local-player ownership, then repeat the three/four-player full-race row.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 normal two-player race completion

- Root cause of the apparently unresponsive manual runs: the GUI launch helper retained obsolete `KARTPAD_RKG_AUTOSTART` and `KARTPAD_RKG_INPUT` values after the parent environment was cleared. Renamed the opt-in diagnostic variables to `_V2`; the stale names are inert in the candidate.
- Tightened GUI keyboard steering independently of physical/touch analog sources: stick pulses are 120 ms at 0.22 normalized magnitude, while gameplay acceleration/reverse retain 500 ms holds and menu-safe keys retain 80 ms pulses.
- Rebuilt, copied, ad-hoc signed, and strictly verified the native arm64 app. The public runtime patch dry-ran cleanly against the pinned WiiCompiled source.
- Normal retail setup: two independently registered Classic channels, Mario and Luigi in Standard Kart M with Automatic drift, 100cc VS Solo Race on Luigi Circuit. P1 completed all three laps through live `U`/`M`/`A`/`D` input; P2 stayed independently connected in the lower pane.
- Both panes reached the retail `FINISH!` transition. The complete standings table followed with Mario 11th/1 point and Luigi 12th/0 points. The active process was the sole KartPad instance; no Dolphin and no Simulator were present.
- The process still exposed only the obsolete pre-rename diagnostic names inherited by the helper. No `_V2` variables were set and the complete console log contained zero `[input-fixture]` entries, proving the completion was not the RKG diagnostic path.
- Focused interaction/captures repeatedly displayed 59.5–60.1 FPS, including 60.0 at finish and standings. This passes the functional two-player cadence observation; G11 retains the separate p99/worst-case qualification.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 29.** Evidence and hashes are under `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-two-player-race/`.
- Next step: complete PRD row 30 with normal three-player and four-player split-screen races, then continue the remaining G10 matrix.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 three-player cadence and keyboard precision calibration

- Confirmed the original retail cadence from the Dolphin Mario Kart Wii oracle: three- and four-player split-screen are intentionally locked to 30 FPS. The native three-player Luigi Circuit gameplay overlay repeatedly reported 29.5–30.1 FPS while menus remained 59.8–60.1 FPS, preserving the mode transition instead of forcing a universal 60 FPS rate.
- Registered three independent Classic channels and repeatedly entered a normal 100cc VS Solo Race with Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi. All three panes rendered independently with AI, items, minimap state, and per-player HUDs active. No Simulator or Dolphin process was running.
- Hands-on steering exposed a GUI-keyboard-specific problem: the previous 0.22 stick magnitude and 120 ms synthetic hold crossed the narrow three-player pane's racing line in only a few generated samples. Reduced the synthetic stick hold to 50 ms and measured 0.12, 0.08, and 0.02 keyboard-only candidates. The 0.08 candidate entered the first curve cleanly; 0.02 could not generate enough steering rate before leaving the surface, so 0.08 is retained. Physical controller input, game physics, and future touch analog input are unchanged.
- Every candidate rebuilt, copied into the app, ad-hoc signed, passed strict signature verification, passed the repository safety audit, and retained a public patch that dry-runs against the pinned WiiCompiled source. Checkpoints `332a6d8`, `3fecc82`, and `ef01110` are on `origin/main`.
- Classification: **In progress for PRD row 30.** Three-player registration, independent panes, and verified original cadence pass, but no complete three-player standings cycle has been accepted yet; four-player full-race evidence is also still open.
- Next step: complete a normal three-player race with the precision candidate, repeat four-player at the same verified 30 FPS cadence, then archive finish/standings/log evidence.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 repeated-race camera lifecycle repair

- Reproduced a deterministic three-player lifecycle crash three times with the normal race → Pause/Quit → Main Menu → second race sequence. Every macOS report was `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in translated guest function `func_805A2034`.
- Focused guest-state instrumentation found a reclaimed race-camera node still linked after scene teardown. Its player slot was `0xff`; the retail update treated that as `-1` and selected the reclaimed-memory sentinel immediately before the kart-object array.
- Added a strict, idempotent generation-time injector for the shared camera-list walker. It removes reclaimed camera nodes with the retail intrusive-list layout, maintains head/tail/count, clears the node links, and resumes the current traversal. Temporary diagnostic traces and the superseded narrow guard are absent from the candidate.
- Regenerated all 72 stable shards, rebuilt, signed, and strictly verified the arm64 app. A fresh single-process run completed the exact failing sequence and reached live three-pane gameplay in the second race without a crash or process relaunch.
- A simultaneous unrelated eight-worker LLVM translation invalidated the later overlay as cadence evidence and was left untouched. A clean-load 29.5–30.1 FPS observation already establishes the retail three-player mode; uncontended resampling and complete three-/four-player standings cycles remain open.
- Classification: **Pass for the repeated-race camera lifecycle defect; PRD row 30 remains in progress.** Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-three-player-camera-lifecycle.md`.
- Next step: checkpoint the reproducible repair, re-sample after host contention clears, and complete the normal three- and four-player race rows.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 audio continuity telemetry

- Audited 83 native logs containing successful non-silent host playback. Fifty-eight older diagnostic runs contained the deliberately one-shot `output queue full` message, which could not distinguish one startup/load burst from sustained loss.
- Confirmed from the SDL 3 default-device contract that a stream opened on `SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK` may migrate automatically when the system default changes; the migration still requires a hands-on KartPad test.
- Added content-free cumulative queue telemetry to the reproducible Apple runtime patch: checks, post-start empty observations, dropped blocks/bytes, submitted bytes, depth range/current depth, and queue limit. Queuing and timing behavior are unchanged.
- The first signed arm64 sample ran for approximately six minutes with 104,960 checks, 40,304,256 submitted bytes, zero post-start empty observations, zero dropped blocks, and a 0–14,796-byte observed range below the 15,360-byte limit.
- Reduced reporting from the fast diagnostic cadence to one report per 8,192 checks (about 30 seconds at the observed rate) plus orderly shutdown, keeping diagnostics bounded. A fresh signed-app smoke run reported exactly at 8,192 and 16,384 checks with zero empty observations or drops. The simultaneous unrelated compilation makes this instrumentation evidence rather than a cadence claim.
- Added `scripts/summarize-audio-queue.py`, a strict content-free telemetry parser with JSON output, monotonic/range checks, `--require-clean`, and a synthetic self-test. It accepts the clean uncontended log and correctly rejects both load-contended runs once their cumulative drop count becomes nonzero.
- Classification: **In progress for PRD row 33.** Bounded telemetry and uncontended queue continuity are healthy; gameplay/pause, device-change, and long-session evidence remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-audio-queue-telemetry.md`.
- Next step: combine the telemetry with the three-player race and audio-transition playtest after host contention clears.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 retail-course oracle preflight

- Parked the live three-player cadence run when eight unrelated `dolrecomp` workers saturated the host; observed 13–18 FPS and audio drops are explicitly rejected as product-performance evidence. The sole KartPad process was returned to Main Menu and closed cleanly. No Simulator was booted.
- Extended the content-free RKG inspector with `--require-course-matrix`. It now rejects missing or duplicate course IDs, unexpected IDs, mismatched face/direction/trick frame counts, empty times, and empty input payloads.
- The data-free self-test covers a valid 32-course matrix and three invalid variants. A one-file negative test exits 1, and the repository safety audit passes.
- Both private disc-derived staff sets pass the strict matrix: 32 files and exactly one input for every retail course ID `0..31`. No RKG payload or other private game content enters the publishable tree.
- Classification: **Preparation pass, not PRD row 22 acceptance.** The complete native per-track execution matrix remains open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-retail-course-oracle.md`.
- Next step: use the validated oracle inventory to drive bounded native course-completion checks while returning to the three-/four-player row after unrelated host contention clears.

### Native completion assertion

- Added `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py` so row 22 runs can be accepted from guest state rather than screenshots or elapsed wall time. It validates the complete CSV schema, monotonic sample/retrace values, consecutive race-stage timing, a later finish-stage transition, and an optional exact RKG input-frame count.
- The data-free self-test rejects an unfinished race and two incorrect frame counts. The retained private N64 Mario Raceway native trace passes at the exact 8,320-frame staff input: race stage 2 covers `240..8319` for 8,080 samples and is followed by finish stage 4. The same trace correctly fails when asked for 8,319 input frames.
- Classification remains **preparation pass, not row 22 acceptance**. This creates the strict native assertion that each remaining track run must satisfy.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Moo Moo Meadows exact native completion

- Started the retail Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Moo Moo Meadows → `Nin★YuNya 01:37.856` → Watch Replay path in the sole native arm64 KartPad process. No Dolphin or Simulator was running.
- First attempt failure signature: the replay visibly reached its finish animation, but startup had logged `[state-trace] unable to open .../private/g10-track-matrix/moo-moo-native.csv` because the absolute parent directory did not exist. No trace was captured, so the visual run is rejected rather than rounded up to Pass.
- Created the exact ignored output directory and reran through the same retail path. The private trace SHA-256 is `b61dc910a085a09c0e62c252a9cd516223cde46d6fb175ce201b8154f719b572`.
- `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6106` passes: race stage 2 covers exactly `240..6105` for 5,866 samples, followed by finish stage 4. A later partial segment is the retail automatic replay loop and is not mistaken for the accepted run.
- Eight unrelated `dolrecomp` workers remained active. Overlay and audio data from this run are rejected as performance/audio evidence; only exact guest-stage completion is accepted.
- Combined with the accepted Luigi Circuit live races and exact N64 Mario Raceway staff trace, PRD row 22 is now **3/32 Pass, 29 Open**. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-retail-tracks/README.md`.
- Next step: continue native exact completion on the remaining initially available cups, then obtain honest progression coverage for the locked cups without treating an unlock bypass as progression evidence.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 three-player camera lifecycle correction

- A later repeat-race failure invalidated the broad `playerId == 0xff` camera-reclamation premise. Retail three-player mode legitimately uses a non-player slot-`0xff` overview camera for its fourth pane; removing it left `RaceCameraMgr::sortedCameras` pointing into reclaimed scene-heap memory.
- Failure signature: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `ScnMgrRace::vf_0xC`, reading through `0x55440003 + 8`, after a three-player race → quit → second-race sequence. A temporary scene-manager guard avoided the crash but exposed the second race as black except for HUD labels, so it was rejected and removed.
- Narrowed the generated camera-list guard to require both slot `0xff` and the observed leading scene-heap poison `0x55440003`. This preserves the legitimate overview camera and removes only the stale reclaimed node.
- Fixed clean regeneration on Apple by reapplying `_kData_*` Mach-O aliases after `generate-data-init` rewrites the blob assembly. Regenerated all 29,637 functions and 72 stable shards, rebuilt, copied, signed, and strictly verified candidate SHA-256 `3d15b8dade09679c0cdc78dd6a40304f28d3888e0fb2471da365e32bc9b6d16f`.
- Exact playtest passed in one PID: first three-player Luigi Circuit race rendered three player panes plus the overview pane, Pause/Quit returned to Main Menu, and the second race again reached live lap-one gameplay with all four panes intact. No Dolphin or booted Simulator was present.
- A separately retained crash report was later matched to this defect: its protected guest access was `0x55440027`, exactly the `0x55440003` reclaimed-scene sentinel plus 36 bytes, and its stack again entered `func_805A2034`. Its UUID identifies the earlier dynamic/Homebrew-linked development binary, not the corrected build or static package candidate. The report is recorded as corroborating pre-fix evidence rather than a current regression.
- The private 267-line PID 48089 log contains two retail `Scene Restart` records and no temporary `scnmgr-lifecycle` trace; its SHA-256 is `9085cef84e023f061e3d1e9ce325ddb8db2bd3a2a1a1a2724efdf4d2ac31ac47`. The public runtime patch dry-runs against the pinned WiiCompiled runtime; the repository safety audit, Python compile check, injector idempotence check, and `git diff --check` pass. Capture-time 14.8–19.8 FPS overlays and 18 audio drops are rejected as cadence/audio evidence.
- Post-run strict signature verification correctly failed because Dawn mutated `UserData/Cache/dawn_cache.db-shm` inside the sealed bundle. The playtested executable itself retained SHA-256 `3d15b8...`; re-sealing restored strict verification and produced signature-different executable SHA-256 `f6b40a...`. Writable runtime state inside the signed bundle is now an explicit G13 packaging risk.
- Classification: **Pass for the corrected repeated-race lifecycle defect; PRD row 30 remains in progress.** Complete three- and four-player standings cycles remain open.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Mushroom Gorge exact native completion

- Started the retail Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Mushroom Gorge → `Nin★Murak 02:16.110` → Watch Replay path in the sole native arm64 KartPad process. No Dolphin or Simulator was running.
- The official regular staff file reports course ID 2 and exactly 8,399 face/direction/trick frames. The ignored native trace SHA-256 is `e20883a2ca6cdfda1bb1f3da75535b852006a44ac87b833c46787ceea88277e4`; the playtested executable SHA-256 is `f6b40a3902ac5ba559d359c5b1cb5488176ebf14bc8eab3da1371c1fd146f9fc`.
- `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 8399` passes: race stage 2 covers exactly `240..8398` for 8,159 samples, followed by finish stage 4. A later partial segment is the retail automatic replay loop and is not mistaken for the accepted run.
- The focused UI observations held at 60.0 FPS, but only exact guest-stage completion is accepted from this run. The already recorded writable-cache bundle-seal issue recurred after execution and remains a G13 packaging risk.
- Combined with Luigi Circuit, Moo Moo Meadows, and N64 Mario Raceway, PRD row 22 is now **4/32 Pass, 28 Open**.
- Next step: continue the exact initially available retail track matrix with Toad's Factory, then progress into available Flower Cup tracks.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Toad's Factory exact native completion

- Ran the retail Time Trials → Mushroom Cup → Toad's Factory → `Nin★Misa 02:22.480` → Watch Replay path in the sole native arm64 KartPad process. No Dolphin or Simulator was running.
- The regular staff file reports course ID 4 and exactly 8,781 frames. `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 8781` passes: stage 2 covers `240..8780` for 8,541 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `259abe8ae52bf1a54b069ded79fbd41cf816fd82dde2fea45a546254d6a58495`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `3927307a33dd9cac30237906489b4423fd7a11ba4ccc3d81f54efbd15281b5d6`.
- Harness failure signature: the persistent GUI launch helper retained the preceding trace environment and wrote the Toad's Factory run over the ignored Mushroom Gorge filename. The exact contents passed before and after relocating them to `toads-factory-native.csv`. The prior Mushroom Gorge summary/hash remain recorded; future traces will launch with a fresh per-process environment and its convenience copy will be regenerated.
- PRD row 22 is now **5/32 Pass, 27 Open**. Next step: make trace-path selection process-local, falsify it with a fresh Mushroom Gorge regeneration, then continue Flower Cup.

### Process-local trace launcher regression

- Added `scripts/launch-g10-traced-runtime.sh` so each trace path is exported only in the runtime process that consumes it. It refuses a relative path, an existing output, a missing parent/runtime, and a second active KartPad process.
- Static syntax, usage, relative-path, existing-output, repository-safety, and diff checks pass. A real direct launch immediately created only the requested `mushroom-gorge-native.csv` and remained the sole game process.
- Repeated the official Mushroom Gorge Watch Replay path. The new private trace SHA-256 is `5aa1026555f10dc683c68fb80476ad077a641e4ab30669f50bebdbb43d3419b5`; the strict 8,399-frame assertion again passes with stage 2 exactly `240..8398` followed by stage 4.
- Classification: **Pass for process-local trace routing and restored Mushroom Gorge convenience evidence.** Capture-time FPS/audio were variable under host load and remain rejected from this harness regression.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Mario Circuit exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for the retail Time Trials → Flower Cup → Mario Circuit → `Nin★==Kony 01:44.777` → Watch Replay path. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- The regular staff file reports course ID 0 and 6,521 frames. `scripts/summarize-mkw-state-trace.py --require-complete --expected-input-frames 6521` passes: stage 2 is exactly `240..6520` for 6,281 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `621ffc9cb573aba276b1c51daa6a2a532970811331f38e999c14fe3f99ec6307`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `bc953f9e6642190a3bfe226558f69f1abfaed4416aeb1c9b7645caccc215ec82`.
- Capture-time FPS and audio drops under current host load are rejected. PRD row 22 is now **6/32 Pass, 26 Open**; Coconut Mall is the next available Flower Cup trace.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Coconut Mall exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Flower Cup → Coconut Mall → `Nin★♪SiM0 02:30.764` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- The regular staff file reports course ID 5 and 9,277 frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..9276` for 9,037 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `64de24b8985da1e190aa8835fd47890253a265612c6c0795a880244af2664272`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `1c2f73f9105d6f41a5ed617f1d22334cd0220bb011ccb010348a8da90635e069`.
- Focused observations reached 60 FPS through indoor/outdoor transitions, escalators, traffic, shadows, and reflections, but capture-time variance and audio drops under current host load are rejected from performance/audio acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **7/32 Pass, 25 Open**. DK Summit is the next available Flower Cup trace.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 DK Summit exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Flower Cup → PAL `DK's Snowboard Cross` → `Nin★mokke 02:34.693` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- The course ID 6 regular staff replay has 9,513 frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..9512` for 9,273 samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `7da9713d157958270635a4e27dd8e34eabe9b6095cdc0df46df018ce9f8dafee`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `bfa5378f45b3a4eba30804d37cdcfb957f065ab34948d2ada17929d1d25e9e28`.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through half-pipe, snow, ski-lift, jump, and trick sections; audio drops under host load are rejected from performance/audio acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **8/32 Pass, 24 Open**. Wario's Gold Mine is the last open Flower Cup track.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Wario's Gold Mine exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Flower Cup → Wario's Gold Mine → `Nin★morimo 02:19.585` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 7 has 8,607 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..8606` for 8,367 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `25c25abdc17a5bcbcb09d016bb2b3b6e9a6f5df2e482649cba6d0c809a08f8ba`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `86d074650e352e266c50d3fc12489fd35854b3ac35d2968062e6ee316d8ddec6`.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through ravines, mine interiors, carts, steam, branching rails, and dense wood geometry; audio drops are rejected from performance/audio acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **9/32 Pass, 23 Open**. The full Mushroom and Flower Cup four-track subsets pass native exact completion.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 GCN Peach Beach exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Shell Cup → GCN Peach Beach → `Nin★HIRO 01:34.233` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 16 has 5,889 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..5888` for 5,649 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `0cf22954bcaa8b59edea83c181abbff5bea735263759df13fa4f637bb9e60b85`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `334e99a89cb1b061efb7f69bf7ab912e98f5661a361869152e76588912a70403`.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through beach, surf, forest, obstacles, and translucent effects; four audio drops under host load are rejected from audio acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **10/32 Pass, 22 Open**. Shell Cup is 1/4; DS Yoshi Falls is next.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 DS Yoshi Falls exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Shell Cup → DS Yoshi Falls → `Nin★DoTak 01:16.461` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 20 has 4,824 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..4823` for 4,584 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `9d52cf29f84851e183c9f4e4afe72531c8229f63ee0eb3431747ba0fea2fbe71`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `ee4260df39e341dd1baecf8d74115e8f28ca770152d980a6aa635c74e59731b5`.
- The private console log SHA-256 is `112ed94e5af89eea89f56db6bed7e31d3c951d09f3df0d085f89d146d78ead4c`. Bounded audio telemetry remains clean through 81,920 checks and 31,456,896 submitted bytes with zero empty observations/drops; this supports gameplay continuity but does not complete row 33's broader scope.
- PRD row 22 is now **11/32 Pass, 21 Open**. Shell Cup is 2/4; SNES Ghost Valley 2 is next.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 SNES Ghost Valley 2 exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Shell Cup → SNES Ghost Valley 2 → `Nin★YOKO. 01:06.595` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.

- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through dark/fogged geometry, animated ghosts, breakaway edges, transparent driver rendering, and boosts; seven audio drops under host load are rejected.
- PRD row 22 is now **12/32 Pass, 20 Open**. Shell Cup is 3/4; the already accepted N64 Mario Raceway completes the cup matrix.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 GBA Shy Guy Beach exact native completion

- The first launch accidentally selected the local Nintendo WFC privacy-notice flow. No agreement or network action occurred; Back was ineffective, so the sole process was closed and its partial trace was moved recoverably to Trash before a fresh offline run.
- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Banana Cup → GBA Shy Guy Beach → `Nin★Kato 01:45.568` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 31 has 6,568 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..6567` for 6,328 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4.

- PRD row 22 is now **13/32 Pass, 19 Open**. Banana Cup is 1/4.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 GCN Waluigi Stadium exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Banana Cup → GCN Waluigi Stadium → `Nin★NARI★ 02:32.882` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 18 has 9,404 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..9403` for 9,164 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4; later movement was the retail automatic replay loop.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `6b2a4644bbff65de2d12ea9a3cc18b7b6845ec3bca7b8546e026cfdbb6d9caeb`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `fa86a907ca2bebbc72eec1baf02cd83f3ceb816e584e33ed3dd23926ab945545`.
- Focused observations displayed 60 FPS through the crowd, dirt, ramp, lighting, boost, and water sections. Private log SHA-256 `0b4c18b56b690eda9a5d07e9a8d9ba5e65169290171468aad45429fe539dae8d` recorded nine audio-queue drops under host load, so this run is rejected for audio-row acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **14/32 Pass, 18 Open**. Banana Cup is 2/4.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 DS Delfino Square exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Banana Cup → DS Delfino Square → `Nin★iwaco 02:41.807` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 23 has 9,939 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..9938` for 9,699 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4; the later partial segment is the retail automatic replay loop.
- The private trace SHA-256 is `9438f871a2f1490c2b989b86f938a9c12aa9cb8f727b5ba7212006f0dde1010f`; the exact executable SHA-256 is `fa86a907ca2bebbc72eec1baf02cd83f3ceb816e584e33ed3dd23926ab945545`.
- Dense town geometry, shadows, bridges, water, and transparent ghost rendering remained intact. GUI sampling observed temporary 46–53 FPS readings before recovery to 60 FPS. Private log SHA-256 `3633b262262416c59f2f915ecd463d4d6ed78e97e8adfe0d464f8b7170f141fc` recorded 25 audio drops, rejected from audio-row acceptance.
- PRD row 22 is now **15/32 Pass, 17 Open**. Banana Cup is 3/4.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 N64 Sherbet Land exact native completion

- Used the process-local trace launcher for Time Trials → Banana Cup → N64 Sherbet Land → `Nin★Sakat 02:48.651` → Watch Replay. Exactly one native KartPad process ran; no Dolphin or Simulator was present.
- Course ID 27 has 10,349 regular-staff frames. The strict assertion passes with stage 2 exactly `240..10348` for 10,109 consecutive samples, followed by stage 4; the later partial segment is the retail automatic replay loop.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 guarded all-cups test fixture

- The remaining four cups were retail-locked on the existing license. Closed the sole process and moved the rejected menu-only SNES Mario Circuit 3 trace recoverably to Trash; it is not completion evidence.
- Backed up the user's ignored 2,867,200-byte RKSYS save byte-for-byte at SHA-256 `4c7b8d596bbef8160ddc24255539321d39c07996c1ade0fd2aa6f90c999a6cf6` before mutation.
- Added `scripts/create-all-cups-test-fixture.py` from the pinned decomp's RKSYS/RKPD layout. It refuses in-place/existing-output writes, validates size/magic/version/stored CRC, changes only the selected GP-completion word plus CRC, and passes positive/corruption/refusal self-tests.
- The ignored private fixture changes license 0 `0x00000000` → `0xffffc000` and has SHA-256 `f09f809cb13bedb6959cf05aeb550fe7c19db2ea74fcc3cf61665d5b0b7b90ec`. The retail license loaded normally and exposed all eight cups.
- Classification: **Pass as a private row-22 test precondition only.** Representative Grand Prix and honest unlock progression remain open and cannot be claimed from this fixture. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-all-cups-fixture.md`.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 full-range keyboard steering correction

- A fresh three-player Luigi Circuit completion attempt exposed that the keyboard Classic-stick bridge used `0.08f` despite its full-normalized-range contract. P1 could accelerate but could not reliably recover from barriers.
- Changed the reproducible Apple-runtime patch and the immediate private generated source to `1.0f`; the arm64 target rebuilt, the patch dry-ran against the pin, the app passed strict signature verification, and live three-player driving showed decisive turn and reverse-turn response.
- Public patch SHA-256 is `9cda1217ab0f9d16549e19f288bd8c61d9ee38f6729eeb43f0a48700198b8fe5`; closed re-sealed executable SHA-256 is `dee991ea9596cf24b05c3329215722a52238d7c3faf5d4e236fcd157f07eee0f`. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-keyboard-steering-range.md`.
- Three private traces remain rejected: the old 8%-range attempt, an over-steered retry with the obsolete cadence, and a calibrated GUI-tap attempt that entered runoff and struck scenery. None reached standings, so row 30 remains open without inflation.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 obsolete-service graceful fallback

- Exercised Nintendo WFC (1P) and Mario Kart Channel in the sole native process. WFC exposed the original data-sharing warning; the privacy-safe Do Not Allow path explicitly disabled WFC and returned to Main Menu. Channel local rankings opened normally.
- No public-service connection, data consent, Dolphin, or Simulator was used. The private log contains DWC initialization with no error/panic signature; the app closed normally.
- The live RKSYS remained byte-identical to the all-cups fixture at SHA-256 `f09f809cb13bedb6959cf05aeb550fe7c19db2ea74fcc3cf61665d5b0b7b90ec`. Private trace SHA-256 is `02eb3c43f1d10302301472ae38dadf976c568297aac639a4da28f6123c4fc186`; private log SHA-256 is `71269bd71150c5016ac5d5a252dba92acf9cf59d15340fcb52aeed2f5d5a2e6f`.
- Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-obsolete-services/`. Its 1,327 audio drops are rejected from audio/performance acceptance.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 accessibility steering cadence refinement

- The first honest 50cc Mushroom Cup attempts exposed a second GUI-input limitation after full physical keyboard range was restored: 50 ms synthetic axis pulses left neutral gaps between accessibility-generated taps, while extending full-strength pulses to 250 ms made each correction too coarse.
- Split physical and synthetic axis levels. Real keyboard holds retain the full normalized endpoint; synthesized GUI taps use 0.35 for 250 ms. Controllers and future touch input remain unchanged.
- Rebuilt and re-sealed the arm64 app. A clean Luigi Circuit smoke run took the opening bend with bounded single-tap corrections; all incomplete cup traces remain rejected, and Grand Prix progression is still open.
- Public patch SHA-256 is `c7aa6bdcdba3dd49bcfb325bbb0074d2a92ee9a6a4c208dbbc1edbb1aabc78be`; closed executable SHA-256 is `454a9eebbeb0d680c77a52480970b512842a3a46c89ef37483f82d3187a2a0fe`.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 Time Trial personal-record lifecycle

- Created and saved a `Player 01:38.880` SNES Mario Circuit 3 personal ghost through the retail result flow. A fresh process loaded the record and its `Watch Replay` path consumed the full stored stream through finish before the normal automatic replay loop.
- Personal Time Trial ghosts are authentically replaced by beating the stored best. Added a strict private-fixture tool that changes only the selected leaderboard timer plus core CRC and leaves the ghost payload untouched; its positive and refusal self-tests pass.
- Rejected an expert-stream divergence, two existing-PB grid-origin mismatches, and a live run that exceeded the retail recorder budget. None is acceptance evidence.
- A later normal live-input run completed all real checkpoints and laps in `05:01.445`, displayed `Saved ghost data for Player!`, and replaced the personal best. Its strict private trace accepts race time `240..18308`, 18,069 consecutive racing samples, and finish stage 4.
- A second fresh process loaded the `Player 05:01.445` card. The final save SHA-256 is `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`; the bounded relaunch audio sample ended with zero empty observations and zero dropped blocks.
- Classification: **PRD row 26 Pass.** Evidence and complete diagnostic boundary: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-time-trial-record/`.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 replay pause/resume audio continuity

- Ran the durable `Player 05:01.445` SNES Mario Circuit 3 replay in the sole signed native process, opened the retail pause menu for 15 seconds, selected `Continue Replay`, and observed the ghost resume normally.
- Before pause, the bounded queue reached 40,960 checks with zero empty observations or drops. While paused it reached its latency cap and deliberately discarded eight stale blocks (3,072 bytes); no underrun occurred. After resume, the count remained exactly eight through 81,920 checks and 31,453,824 submitted bytes, proving no continuing starvation or drop cascade.
- The live save remained byte-identical at SHA-256 `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 33's pause/resume subcase; row 33 remains in progress.** Output-device migration, subjective listening, and the required long session remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-audio-pause-resume/`.

## 2026-08-29 — G10 live output-device migration

- Ran the durable `Player 05:01.445` SNES Mario Circuit 3 replay in the sole signed native process. With no Simulator or reference emulator active, changed the macOS default output from the user's original `Jump Desktop Audio` to `MacBook Air Speakers`, observed active replay, then restored and verified the original output.
- Pre-switch telemetry reached 57,344 checks with zero empty observations and zero drops. The two route transitions deliberately discarded 101 stale blocks (38,784 bytes) in bounded bursts; no empty observation occurred. The counter then remained exactly 101 through 98,304 checks and 37,709,568 submitted bytes while the replay remained visibly live.
- The app closed normally, the final queue was bounded at 6,468/15,360 bytes, and the RKSYS save remained byte-identical at SHA-256 `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
- Classification: **Pass for PRD row 33's output-device-change subcase.** This proves continuity and recovery without sustained underrun or latency growth; it does not claim subjective absence of a transient. Subjective listening and the required long representative session remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g10-audio-device-migration/`.

## 2026-08-29 — G13 distributable static macOS package checkpoint

- Audited the working runtime's linkage and found a real compatibility defect: it declared macOS 14.0 while loading Homebrew dependencies built for macOS 26. Replaced host-discovered Abseil, SDL3, libpng, and FreeType with pinned static source builds under the declared deployment target.
- The first relink was rejected at undefined `func_8055531C`. The build cache showed the obsolete 10,836-function G6 manifest; the function exists in the authoritative 29,637-function G8 full-title graph. Reconfigured with only that corrected manifest and linked successfully without a stub or fallback. The preparation script now defaults to the full graph.
- Added first-party source-path redaction, a fail-closed macOS packager, and a package auditor. The packager includes the DSP ROM, initial pipeline cache, first-run Wii bootstrap, and original ICNS while refusing private/writable state and non-system dependencies.
- The regenerated candidate identifies committed source `17cee52d92b70b73e8216a8469dfba668cf4022d`, is arm64 with a macOS 14.0 floor, has only Apple system dynamic dependencies, contains no builder-home path or disc image, and passes strict ad-hoc codesign and bundle audits.
- Candidate hashes: unsigned packaged runtime `544e47f42718db5894127cef7712374d2fd871a6cac55645a87a0b6ec6af2303`; signed executable `05f868bc6826ee009356abc236e9ce507a123e687d86ced0fb33665ab1a11d36`; bundle-content audit `8a8ff8b38aa699070f3e6ad20a251a4adafb0a3d5cdb7df71aed90bacecbd602`.
- Classification: **Pass for G13 build/link/package audit only.** Exact-package launch, Application Support relocation, and gameplay remain open. The candidate was not launched because the one-game-instance rule protects the active long replay. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g13-macos-package/`.

## 2026-08-29 — G13 static-source archive pin completion

- Audited every FetchContent input used by the new static macOS graph. Aurora already enforced hashes for Dawn, libpng, FreeType, xxHash, fmt, ImGui, SQLite, zstd, and Tracy; only Abseil 20240722.0 and SDL 3.4.4 lacked archive digests.
- Declared those two inputs before Aurora so CMake's first-declaration rule enforces exact SHA-256 values. Generated URL metadata now contains the expected hashes, both downloaded archives match, patch dry-run passes, and reconfiguration succeeds.
- Ninja reported no work and the runtime remained byte-identical at SHA-256 `4c12eadfd5edf0dd106b76692bef82d8162026684969c7b498a0d3a830f4a0a5`, confirming a reproducibility-only change.

## 2026-08-29 — G15 exact SunPad overlay baseline, Classic adapter, and native shell

- Imported the exact SunPad touch overlay, settings, diagnostics, input state, and mixer from pinned commit `e43f0ea6b797e5110787171957c9dc3c6213269c`, together with the complete GPLv3 text and explicit upstream provenance. A repository verifier proves the nine source files and license remain byte-identical to the local pinned reference.
- Used Nintendo's *Mario Kart Wii Instruction Booklet* Classic Controller diagram rather than inferred mappings. Added a separate adapter from SunPad's normalized GameCube-shaped input to KartPad's existing Classic ABI: A accelerate, B/R drift-brake, L item, X/ZR rear view, Plus pause, and D-pad trick/wheelie.
- Added an arm64 Objective-C++ contract test covering every button independently, their simultaneous union, both sticks, and connection state. The focused build/test and exact-snapshot verifier pass.
- Added a real UIKit lifecycle and `CAMetalLayer` iOS target that compiles the byte-identical overlay directly, packages the original light/dark/tinted icon assets and privacy manifest, and builds as a system-library-only arm64 iOS Simulator app with a 16.0 minimum. The fail-closed shell auditor passes.
- The launch runner audits before install, refuses a second booted Simulator, and refuses to overlap the live macOS game. Its concurrent-game guard exited 75 as designed; no Simulator was booted during the protected macOS soak.
- Classification: **mobile shell/source integration in progress**. Direct-copy, input-boundary, native build, package, and concurrency-guard evidence pass; the full retail game graph is not linked and no Simulator gameplay, visual comparison, or touch-feel acceptance is claimed. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-29/g15-sunpad-overlay.md`.

## 2026-08-29 — G14 shared-core iOS promotion checkpoint

- The first root-graph iOS configure failed before generation because Xcode left `CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` empty. The failure was not repeated unchanged: Apple architecture detection now requires one explicit `CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` value when that field is empty, and the manifest records the resolved value.
- Corrected the dormant iOS host options so `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS` is an accepted Darwin-family target, exactly one Simulator/device kind is required, and macOS-only AppKit fixtures and process tests remain excluded.
- Built `kartpad_host`, `kartpad_memory`, `kartpad_scheduler`, and `kartpad_g7_translated` as arm64 iOS Simulator static libraries, then compiled the same warning-as-error libraries and the complete unsigned shell against the physical `iphoneos` 16.0 SDK. The resulting Mach-O reports platform `IOS`, minimum 16.0, includes both iPhone/iPad icons, and links only Apple system libraries. This is build portability, not a signed-device claim.
- Added a bounded startup bridge that executes the translated G7 command fixture through checked memory, validates its exact output, executes a scheduler thread, and checks the host monotonic clock. The app binary contains the bridge plus memory/scheduler/translated symbols; the package auditor now rejects a shell without this core integration.
- Classification: **G14 core promotion in progress**. Cross-compilation and exact app linkage pass. The full retail graph is not linked and runtime success awaits the sole Simulator after the protected macOS soak; no boot, race, audio, save, lifecycle, or touch claim is made.

## 2026-08-30 — G10 two-hour representative audio continuity

- Ran exactly one native arm64 KartPad process for 2:00:18 with no Dolphin/reference process or Simulator active. Guest-state tracing observed 425,142 samples: 22 exact complete `240..18308` replay segments and one intentionally partial final segment.
- Last observed cumulative audio telemetry reached 2,408,448 checks and 924,776,448 submitted bytes with zero empty-before-push observations. The bounded queue discarded 175 stale blocks / 67,200 bytes (about 0.0073% of submitted bytes) without sustained starvation; the stream did not emit an explicit final telemetry record.
- A one-minute RSS sampler covered only the final 2,040 seconds: 35 samples, 227,040–263,600 KiB, first 257,984 KiB, last 262,000 KiB. It is useful bounded evidence, not a whole-run leak proof.
- The process remained visibly live around 59–60 displayed FPS, closed normally, produced no new crash report, and preserved the RKSYS SHA-256 `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
- Classification: **Pass for the long representative continuity subcase; PRD row 33 remains in progress.** Subjective listening remains hands-on, and G11 still requires its separate eight-hour soak. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g10-audio-two-hour.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 exact branded package, storage, and gameplay

- Separated installed durable state under `~/Library/Application Support/KartPad` from rebuildable cache state under `~/Library/Caches/KartPad`; portable development mode remains beside the executable. Added fail-closed storage-layout and exact-package launch guards.
- Corrected the installed initial-cache lookup to `Contents/Resources` and replaced a Windows-formatted NAND title path with the host path translator. A clean-storage run seeded 1,199 cache rows, created a real POSIX NAND hierarchy, and created no backslash-named component.
- Branded the native process and game window as `KartPad`, then produced the exact source-`325d5f3` package. It is 80 MiB, native arm64, macOS 14.0+, Apple-system-only, ad-hoc signed, contains the original icon, and passes the fail-closed package audit at bundle-content hash `12e827fdaf206df3689ab0fe0b73fa7ebe20fe3827b538d8fe7c21e8ac25e3db`.
- Launched that exact package with no Simulator/reference process, reached title, loaded `Player`, selected 50cc Mushroom Cup Grand Prix, reached live Luigi Circuit at a displayed 60 FPS, accepted accelerate input, and closed normally. The bundle and save remained unchanged.
- Classification: **Pass for exact-package audit, installed storage, configured launch, and live gameplay; G13 remains in progress.** Native guided first run, settings, diagnostics, data management, update-in-place, and clean-clone self-build remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-exact-macos-package.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — supplied historical three-player crash report classified

- Read the supplied macOS report for PID 67587: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGBUS)` at `0x0000100055440027`, top frame `func_805A2034`, after a second three-player race transition.
- This is the already documented reclaimed-camera-node signature whose poisoned scene-heap pointer carried `0x55440003`. The guarded lifecycle correction and exact formerly failing second-race regression already pass; the report is retained as historical corroboration rather than classified as a new current-candidate crash.
- Full three- and four-player races through standings remain open because fixing and regression-testing the transition does not itself prove PRD row 30.

## 2026-08-30 — rejected honest Grand Prix driving attempt

- Backed up the installed and portable configuration/save state before launching the sole exact macOS package. The pre-run RKSYS SHA-256 was `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
- Started a normal 50cc Mushroom Cup as Mario / Standard Kart M / Automatic and reached live Luigi Circuit at the displayed 60 FPS target. Accessibility-generated accelerate and steering inputs were accepted, but the synthetic driver left the course boundary and never resumed retail checkpoint progression.
- The rejected trace contains 25,034 samples, stayed in race stage 2 with observed race time `240..24063`, and has SHA-256 `785f8163e4f54bb293ba8b3ebf25e8faa5f7e3c547f822103611f52f45ad7936`. It has no accepted completion segment and is retained as test-control evidence only.
- KartPad closed normally, produced no new crash, and the save remained byte-identical. Classification: **no Grand Prix progress and no candidate runtime defect**; honest progression remains open.

## 2026-08-30 — G14/G15 dual-Simulator shell runtime checkpoint

- The first iPad rebuild still carried a stale configure-time `Info.plist` without the newly added scene manifest. Regenerated the CMake Xcode project, verified `UIApplicationSceneManifest` in the built product, and moved lifecycle ownership to a `UIWindowSceneDelegate` with an explicit landscape geometry request.
- Removed dependence on `UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds`; the root view now receives its size from the active scene. Both iPhone 17 Pro and iPad Pro 13-inch classes launch the linked mobile core and show `KartPad mobile core checks passed`, render the byte-identical SunPad overlay, expose the complete persistent three-dot menu, and return from background with input cleared and the overlay active.
- On iPadOS 26, the accepted landscape scene is letterboxed while the simulated hardware remains physically portrait, then fills the display after hardware rotation. This matches Apple's iPadOS 26 scene/windowing model and is not misclassified as race or touch-feel acceptance.
- The compact iPhone menu scrolls to controller mapping, touch settings, game data, and report actions. Touch settings and the layout editor are reachable; the game-data delegate currently shows a bounded integration alert and is not a real-import claim.
- Corrected an intermittent shell-auditor failure caused by producer/`rg -q` pipelines under `pipefail`; captured `find`, `strings`, and `nm` output now makes the oracle deterministic. Simulator and device artifacts each passed 50 consecutive audits, the exact SunPad snapshot and Classic-input contract pass, and repository safety passes.
- A rejected intermediate permanently locked the first landscape orientation and made the opposite iPhone landscape side upside down. Removed that lock and rotated the final candidate through both landscape sides; both remain upright.
- Final Simulator executable SHA-256 is `91a202f0ee62212b3c23d1616bda9a9595a6c498ca9ff4aa21de10b8723d11cd`; unsigned device executable SHA-256 is `c380a319a972971b74e0b2684824e7dde520788804bf8e1a1e712ecc556a632b`. Both Simulator classes were fully terminated and shut down; none remains booted.
- Classification: **Pass for exercised G14/G15 shell-level subcases; G14/G15 remain open.** The retail graph, real import/services, Metal gameplay, audio, saves, complete touch-driven races, controller handoff, gyro, and physical-device execution remain unclaimed. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-simulator-shell/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 complete retail Simulator link checkpoint

- The first full iOS runtime compile reached the final link before failing correctly: encounter/dawn-build's official iOS archive declared physical platform `IOS`, so Apple refused to link it into an `IOSSIMULATOR` executable.
- Built the same pinned Dawn release commit `13abc3bc8ea2d3c2050f9e77a12d012108ceee24` for arm64 Simulator. Normalized its archive index and package metadata; two complete package passes produced the same SHA-256 `c9272faca14a307e4545ea83cb66ab2f65e87fa33a0a687bf5c702666271bc03`. Representative WebGPU and Metal objects declare `IOSSIMULATOR`, iOS 16.0.
- Added a fail-closed Simulator Dawn builder and full iOS runtime preparation script. The runtime patch now independently pins macOS, device-iOS, and Simulator-iOS Dawn digests and allows cross-root package discovery only around Aurora's explicit hashed dependencies.
- A clean upstream build exposed a latent serialized-patch defect: the KPAD hunk header undercounted its output by nine lines, silently truncating the function. Corrected the header, proved the patch applies completely, and verified a second untouched patched source tree is byte-identical to the resumed build source.
- The clean graph compiled all 29,065 base translated functions, static registrations/dispatch, runtime/HLE, SDL UIKit/CoreAudio, and Aurora GX/Metal. The 78,548,760-byte arm64 binary declares `IOSSIMULATOR`, iOS 16.0, links only Apple system libraries/frameworks, and has SHA-256 `1d970f1ae75b5b0c8f3287df89d02d9b1b38524960808aa867868d30c855315c`.
- Classification: **Pass for full retail Simulator compile/link; G14 remains open.** The generated standalone bundle has placeholder metadata and is not launched. UIKit embedding, real data/storage, title/menu, Metal gameplay, audio, save/relaunch, complete races, and touch-feel acceptance remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-full-runtime-link.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 full retail UIKit app checkpoint

- Integrated SDL's iOS application wrapper into the full runtime rather than creating a competing app delegate. After Aurora creates its real SDL/UIKit Metal window, KartPad attaches the byte-identical SunPad overlay to that window and merges its separately adapted Classic input into both retail KPAD status paths.
- The first real integration compile rejected the Objective-C++ sources because they inherited a C++-mode PCH. Excluded only the six mobile `.mm` sources from that PCH; the full translated C++ graph retains its release configuration. The corrected Ninja proof and clean Xcode Release app both link.
- Xcode compiled the original light/dark/tinted icon catalog into `Assets.car`, resolved the `dev.kartpad.app` iPhone/iPad metadata and SDL scene delegate, copied the privacy/DSP/cache/bootstrap resources, and validated the product. The bundle contains no private disc/save or host dynamic dependency.
- Serialized the integration as a second fail-closed upstream patch plus dedicated build, full-game bundle-audit, and guarded one-Simulator launch scripts. A fresh two-patch source matches the compiled source byte-for-byte, the exact SunPad verifier passes, and the tracked build script completes incrementally with the same hashes.
- Final prelaunch executable SHA-256 is `9a5d69076299324e7f33ae10366a97cdccc512dc4af87c0d77fcdb4af35d4ca0`; `Assets.car` is `18de0779809a419002a50074b1d9e45e83aa89dfaa4e4355e8ed26c45c7fb346`.
- Classification: **Pass for full retail native-app integration and audit; G14 remains open.** No Simulator was booted for this checkpoint. Single-iPhone launch, runtime diagnosis, Metal/audio/touch gameplay, save/relaunch, and complete race are next, followed only after shutdown by iPad. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-full-game-app.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 full retail iPhone launch, edge diagnosis, and Multiplayer access

- Installed exact executable SHA-256 `e31a0d0a8f5583b497141c93aeb63aa40b5ab2e0c2b6f79b3e27cb47322497b7` on the sole iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.5 Simulator. The guarded runner audited and signed a temporary copy, every other Simulator remained shut down, and the full retail title booted from the staged extracted game data.
- Reinstalling migrated the data container to a new UUID, proving the absolute game-data root was unsafe. Switched the live configuration to relative `dvd_root = "GameData"`; the new container retained the 2.5 GiB data, `sys/main.dol` SHA-256 `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05`, and booted again.
- Reproduced the reported striped/checker edge pixels only in dynamic fill. A controlled A/B showed clean uniform pillarboxes in Original 4:3 and clean bounded output in 16:9. Added a generated runtime bridge for SunPad's exact persisted aspect, render-scale, and FPS settings; restored Original 4:3 as the stable default. Combined same-state reference/prototype comparisons are stored with the evidence.
- Added a KartPad-owned `Multiplayer…` action around the unchanged, byte-verified SunPad menu. Its native setup sheet opens and routes to the existing controller mapping. Independently, touch A and D-pad navigation entered Mario Kart's retail Multiplayer → 2 Players → Register Controllers flow.
- The original mobile adapter exposed Classic bits, while some retail menu paths also consumed core fields. Added a reproducible bridge mirroring Classic A/B/Plus/Minus/D-pad into matching core bits in both KPAD paths. Touch then advanced title, navigated menus, selected a full 50cc Grand Prix setup, and reached live Luigi Circuit. Background/Home and foreground resume also passed.
- Accessibility click synthesis cannot establish sustained finger-held acceleration or touch feel; the live race is therefore entry evidence, not a completed race. Save/relaunch and a complete touch-driven race remain open, followed by iPad only after shutting down this iPhone.
- Classification: **Pass for iPhone retail boot, Metal presentation, aspect containment, touch menu navigation, Multiplayer access/registration entry, live-race entry, and lifecycle resume; G14/G15 remain open.** Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-full-game-simulator/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 full retail iPad sequential pass and save/relaunch

- Pushed the iPhone checkpoint at `2a4b883`, terminated its app, and shut down the iPhone before booting the iPad Pro 13-inch (M5) / iOS 26.5 Simulator. No second Simulator was booted at any time.
- Installed the same audited executable SHA-256 `e31a0d0a8f5583b497141c93aeb63aa40b5ab2e0c2b6f79b3e27cb47322497b7`, staged the same extracted data, set the portable relative `dvd_root = "GameData"`, and verified the same `main.dol` SHA-256 before launch.
- The portrait-hardware state correctly letterboxed the requested landscape scene; after rotating the simulated hardware, the original 4:3 presentation filled the iPad cleanly without the iPhone fill-screen edge artifacts. The exact overlay scaled across the screen and the complete three-dot menu, including the KartPad-owned `Multiplayer…` entry, remained accessible.
- Touch created a new `Player` license, reached Main Menu, selected the default 50cc Mushroom Cup flow, and reached live Luigi Circuit. Home/background and foreground resume returned to the game.
- The resulting `rksys.dat` SHA-256 `5291cecd0ae1749a7996dfd8f3bc53978a9af08fe9aaf639a831214d6bb24f42` remained byte-identical across terminate/relaunch, and the `Player` license was visible after relaunch.
- Shut down the iPad after evidence capture; no Simulator remains booted. Classification: **Pass for sequential iPad retail boot, Metal/title/menu, touch first-run and race entry, menu scaling, lifecycle, and save/relaunch preservation; G14/G15 remain open for completed races and hands-on control/audio acceptance.** Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-full-game-simulator/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 iPhone reinstall and save/relaunch closure

- With every Simulator shut down, installed the same audited iPhone candidate through the guarded runner. The install migrated the app container again while preserving relative `dvd_root = "GameData"`, extracted `main.dol` SHA-256 `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05`, and the existing save.
- Touch skipped the intro, loaded the preserved `Player` license, and reached Main Menu. Terminated and relaunched the app, then repeated the touch path through the same license to Single Player.
- The iPhone `rksys.dat` remained byte-identical at SHA-256 `87473fa67e0ec2345d471584979217f6dbd7316ed47db054ce565269ef316d58` across terminate/relaunch. Shut down the iPhone afterward; no Simulator remains booted.
- Classification: **Pass for iPhone reinstall/container migration and save/relaunch preservation.** Together with the prior iPad hash proof, save/relaunch now passes on both Simulator classes; complete touch-driven races and hands-on control/audio remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-full-game-simulator/iphone-save-relaunch-main-menu.jpeg`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 four-player controller and Multiplayer UI checkpoint

- Found that the exact SunPad overlay already hid itself for physical controllers, but KartPad had not included SunPad's controller publisher and the retail KPAD bridge consumed mobile input only on channel zero. Imported SunPad's controller slots and mapping sources byte-for-byte, extended the snapshot verifier from nine to twelve files, and added a KartPad manager that preserves SunPad's stable Player 1–4 assignment and persisted mapping behavior.
- Player 1 now enters the exact SunPad mixer alongside touch; Players 2–4 publish independent states and rising-edge latches. The reproducible fifth runtime patch reads those states from the matching retail KPAD channels. Deterministic slot, mapping, axes, trigger, and final Classic-bit tests pass.
- Rebuilt and audited the complete retail Simulator app. The fail-closed auditor now requires the per-player bridge and controller classes; executable SHA-256 is `be38d5d261e5ec8baa95bbe840b85e69ab7ad7b3db18f5e2e82cbf6e02e2977c`.
- Booted exactly one iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. The preserved game data loaded into live gameplay, the Simulator extended `Gamepad` registered in Player 1, `Multiplayer…` reported one connected controller, and `Controller Setup…` presented the mapping/slot guidance after a corrected action-sheet transition.
- Classification: **Pass for four-channel controller publication, runtime linkage/audit, Simulator discovery, and Multiplayer/Controller Setup UI.** Physical-device controller feel and a complete controller-driven multiplayer race remain hands-on gates. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-controller-multiplayer/`.

## 2026-08-30 — rejected three-player standings automation

- Launched one native development runtime with three independently registered Classic slots and entered retail 3 Player VS Race. Luigi Circuit and SNES Mario Circuit 3 both rendered the expected three player panes plus the legitimate fourth overview camera at the retail 30 FPS cadence; the process did not crash.
- The baseline synthetic steering repeatedly left the course and never reached standings. Its content-private trace contains 15,723 samples, zero finish segments, and SHA-256 `eeb6ec4ca472fc4fcfe6f86208b2ddf537b9fad548510f729417442cbe8eb863`; the two largest uninterrupted race-time spans were `241..12001` and `240..14906`.
- Changed only the accessibility fallback steering level from `0.35` to `0.18` in a throwaway candidate. It still became trapped in corners. That trace contains 4,127 samples, one `241..6483` incomplete segment, zero finishes, and SHA-256 `acef1bf8b12c3203a980ed405f3ae9d8e7d73f4998a34f3bf2b410528e9e111f`.
- Rejected and fully reverted the unproven `0.18` change. Classification: **no standings progress and no current runtime crash**. This is a synthetic-driver limitation; a hands-on three-/four-player standings cycle remains open.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 opaque letterbox and Multiplayer regression

- Diagnosed the supplied edge artifacts as transparent presentation bands around the fitted game viewport. The intermediate Aurora snapshot cleared RGB but did not require opaque alpha, allowing stale Metal/Simulator content to remain visible outside the game.
- Added one reproducible Aurora patch that clears the entire snapshot to opaque black. iOS preparation copies the immutable pinned Aurora checkout into the disposable runtime source before applying it; macOS and the reference checkout remain untouched.
- Rebuilt and audited the complete 29,065-function Simulator app. The exact twelve-file SunPad verifier passes and the final executable SHA-256 is `4f7cc915762e90d70db1e11d35fd9255877f7e15e56b9510ab0878653d16204c`.
- Booted exactly one iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. Matching title-intro and live-game states retain uniform black bands with no striped/checker/FPS leakage. The three-dot menu still presents `Multiplayer…`; its sheet reports one connected Simulator gamepad and exposes `Controller Setup…`.
- Terminated the app and shut down the Simulator. Classification: **Pass for opaque fitted-output containment and Multiplayer UI regression; G14/G15 remain open.** Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-opaque-letterbox/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 private extracted-game-data import boundary

- Connected the exact SunPad-derived `Import or Reimport Game Data` action to the system Files folder picker and `Import from SunPad Folder` to KartPad's Files-visible Documents boundary.
- Added fail-closed extracted-disc validation for the runtime-critical surface, the `RMCP01` PAL revision-0 boot header/Wii magic, and the supported `sys/main.dol` hash. Accepted data is copied into a unique private staging directory, assigned iOS file protection, excluded from backup, and atomically swapped into `GameData` with rollback of the prior copy on failure. Missing `Config.toml` is created with the relative game-data root, and stale incomplete import staging is cleaned before retry.
- Rebuilt and audited the full 29,065-function Simulator app; the exact twelve-file SunPad snapshot remains byte-identical. The final executable SHA-256 is `c676a066fd9fe28f8a64ea43ee0286c9989a4e3fcf60bb982c3980d09f70b9b7`.
- Booted exactly one iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. The real folder picker opened and cancelled cleanly back to live gameplay. With no Documents candidate, the SunPad-folder route displayed its bounded guidance alert and also returned cleanly. The app was terminated and the Simulator shut down.
- Classification: **Pass for the real picker/no-candidate UI routes and compiled private validation/staging/rollback boundary; G14/G15 remain open.** A successful full-size copy, injected-failure rollback, WBFS extraction, true no-data first launch, and safe active-data removal are not claimed. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 full-size import and Simulator Metal regression

- Created content-private APFS clones of the current 2.5 GiB extracted data as a rollback control and Files-visible import fixture. The first real import failed closed at hashing rather than touching installed data; `NSInputStream` could not read the Simulator-mapped file. Replaced it with bounded mapped `NSData` hashing and retained the exact supported-DOL digest check.
- The rejected attempt later produced a new Simulator `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `pthread_getschedparam` under `MTLCompilerScheduler::assignQosToRequest`. Its transcript proved Aurora had six pipeline compiler workers. Added a Simulator-only reproducible Aurora patch that uses one pipeline compiler worker and corrected its telemetry; physical-device and macOS worker policy is unchanged.
- The repaired candidate completed two full-size imports. The final run left exactly one relative `dvd_root`, zero staging/rollback directories, matching installed/source DOL hashes, and an unchanged save SHA-256 `87473fa67e0ec2345d471584979217f6dbd7316ed47db054ce565269ef316d58`. A cold relaunch booted the retail game from the imported copy, with transcript telemetry reporting one priority/one background pipeline worker.
- Final audited executable SHA-256 is `f19459f937834002cc04400dd00317df92deb63d77f06a2c64ff986bc2806aeb`. Classification: **Pass for the successful full-size import/swap/cold-relaunch path and the observed Simulator compiler-crash regression; G14/G15 remain open.** Injected-failure rollback, WBFS extraction, true no-data first launch, and safe active-data removal remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 injected import rollback closure

- Added a Simulator-only launch-environment hook immediately after the prior `GameData` is moved aside and before staging is installed. Physical-iOS compilation excludes the hook, and the bundle auditor enforces that boundary.
- Forced that exact swap failure against the 2.5 GiB Files-visible fixture. KartPad presented the bounded failure alert, restored the prior tree, retained the supported DOL SHA-256 `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05` and save SHA-256 `87473fa67e0ec2345d471584979217f6dbd7316ed47db054ce565269ef316d58`, and left zero staging/rollback directories.
- A normal cold relaunch returned to live gameplay from the restored copy. The content-private fixture was moved to Trash, the app terminated, and the sole Simulator shut down.
- Final audited executable SHA-256 is `87636292fd6ea11b5bb7560d05d30f19858dbf3a22006daebd2c67deefb25efb`. Classification: **Pass for injected swap-failure rollback; G14/G15 remain open.** WBFS extraction, true no-data first launch, and safe active-data removal remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/rollback-injected-failure.jpg`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 true first-launch import and interrupted recovery

- A genuinely empty iPhone Simulator container previously reached DVD initialization and exited because no `dvd_root` existed. Added an iOS-only gate before runtime configuration and Aurora initialization. It presents native first-launch guidance, the real Files folder picker, and the bounded KartPad-folder route until validated private data is available.
- Refactored the existing importer behind the first-launch and in-game flows. The gate recovers a sole stranded rollback when no active tree exists, removes stale staging, validates the complete extracted surface and supported DOL, and performs the protected staging/swap without duplicating policy.
- The clean onboarding route imported the complete 2.5 GiB Files-visible fixture. Because runtime settings can initialize before `main`, the gate explicitly reloads the newly written relative `dvd_root`; the same process then installed the exact SunPad overlay and reached live gameplay without relaunching.
- Simulated an interrupted process by leaving only `GameData.rollback-interrupted-test`. The next ordinary launch restored it automatically, removed the orphan, preserved supported DOL SHA-256 `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05` and save SHA-256 `708c7a040e0cfe6cd815690e63f46d1678f17899bce0e786f7480030830f1d13`, and returned directly to gameplay.
- Hardened rollback cleanup so an invalid active directory can never cause the last valid rollback to be discarded. The final candidate showed onboarding while retaining that rollback, then restored it after the invalid active tree was moved aside; the exact DOL/save hashes remained unchanged and zero import/rollback directories remained.
- Re-prepared from immutable pins and rebuilt the serialized 29,065-function graph through all 852 Ninja targets. After the final rollback-retention hardening, its rebuilt binary SHA-256 is `966b76d284ff7524f6592667c45dbf63146d57fdf4aac42b1700accd722908f5`; the exercised Xcode Simulator candidate passes the strengthened fail-closed audit at SHA-256 `30b78457e93a0ff75a9228d61366ede342d5546574da2ea672d0d67fc922f7d9`.
- Classification: **Pass for true no-data first launch, same-session full import, serialized clean rebuild, and next-launch interrupted-swap recovery; G14/G15 remain open.** Direct WBFS extraction and safe active-data removal remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 safe scheduled game-data removal

- Replaced the removal placeholder without deleting files under the active guest. The unchanged exact SunPad confirmation now delegates to a KartPad-native scheduled-removal alert. It writes an atomic protected marker, states that deletion occurs before emulation on the next launch, and offers `Undo`.
- Exercised Undo first: the marker disappeared, the full active tree remained, and gameplay continued. Scheduled removal again, confirmed the active tree remained present until ordinary termination, then relaunched the app.
- The early launch gate deleted the complete 2.5 GiB `GameData`, import/rollback directories, and marker before runtime initialization, then presented `Game Data Required`. The separate NAND save remained byte-identical at SHA-256 `87473fa67e0ec2345d471584979217f6dbd7316ed47db054ce565269ef316d58`.
- A rejected CoreSimulator clone retained source-device absolute registry paths, so it was discarded before app launch or container mutation. The pass used a genuinely new disposable iPhone Simulator and a private APFS-cloned fixture; that device was terminated, shut down, and deleted afterward. No Simulator remains booted.
- Final audited executable SHA-256 is `9a6cd90f15a4174369445a65875aa27627efa717e94a28bff37f1845104e3019`; the clean serialized graph relink is `07c4da68ae6d08d0cb0045bbf84f641d65e708285517271490687861d79b7afd`. The final hardening also cancels the marker if no presenter exists and reports an Undo deletion error instead of silently scheduling removal. Classification: **Pass for explicit, undoable, pre-emulation game-data removal with save preservation; G14/G15 remain open.** Direct WBFS extraction remains open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/removal-scheduled.png` and `removal-applied.png`.

## 2026-08-30 — supplied Simulator crash report classification

- Classified the supplied `05:34:43` crash as an additional record of the already observed pre-mitigation Simulator Metal failure: six concurrent Aurora pipeline workers appear in the report, and the fault is `pthread_getschedparam` under `MTLCompilerScheduler::assignQosToRequest`.
- The report's binary UUID `69F94E4A-0116-3B5C-B351-25A9DD657317` and crash time both predate the `06:02:11` single-worker patch and the current `06:56:32` candidate. The current binary UUID is `797CCC1D-A1FA-38E5-A36B-27255FC186EE`, so the report cannot describe it.
- Classification: **historical corroboration, not a current-candidate regression.** The Simulator-only one-worker policy and post-fix import/cold-launch/recovery/removal regressions remain the applicable result; device-iOS and macOS policies remain unchanged. A sanitized classification is stored at `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-game-data-import/metal-compiler-crash-classification.md`; the full host report is not copied into the repository.

## 2026-08-30 — G15 configurable motion-steering checkpoint

- Added a KartPad-owned CoreMotion steering service without modifying the exact twelve-file SunPad snapshot. It defaults off, persists enabled/inverted/sensitivity state, calibrates and recenters from gravity-plane angle, handles wrap/dead-zone/full-lock bounds, yields to physical controllers, and mixes by strongest magnitude with Player 1 touch steering.
- Added `Motion Steering…` beside the existing KartPad-owned `Multiplayer…` entry while preserving SunPad's original children. The action sheet offers enable/disable, recenter, invert, and sensitivity controls on sensor-capable hardware and an accurate unavailable explanation in Simulator.
- The focused mapping suite passes invalid-input, dead-zone, direction, wrap, inversion, sensitivity, and clamp cases alongside the existing touch and physical-controller suites. The complete 29,065-function Simulator app compiled, linked CoreMotion, and passed the strengthened audit at SHA-256 `c87a1c4ef6577dce0e72b27c4070d611cae6f4b7a5e59284cd6bb1d94f12e25c`. The same implementation also compiled/linked and passed the IOS shell audit for unsigned arm64 physical iOS.
- Booted exactly one iPhone Simulator with the final candidate. The live retail menu exposed the new action, its unavailable fallback rendered correctly, touch/controller availability remained explicit, gameplay continued afterward, and a Home/background/foreground cycle restored the live overlay. Terminated KartPad and shut down the Simulator; none remains booted.
- Classification: **Pass for implementation, deterministic input contract, Simulator/device compilation, package audit, and Simulator fallback UI; G15 remains open.** Physical sensor calibration/feel, controller handoff during motion input, and a complete motion-steered race remain hands-on gates. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-motion-steering/`.

## 2026-08-30 — public README mobile-state correction

- Reworked the repository landing page using SunPad's direct documentation pattern after its mobile section became materially stale. It now leads with the actual macOS plus iPhone/iPad development state, accurately describes the exercised private first-launch import/recovery/removal boundary, and explains why translation/signing remain Mac-side.
- Added the reproducible iOS Simulator preparation/build commands, exact SunPad/KartPad input ownership boundary, Multiplayer and motion-steering behavior, first-launch steps, honest hands-on limitations, and paired iPhone/iPad retail screenshots already accepted as Simulator evidence.
- Classification: **Pass for current public documentation accuracy; no runtime goal changes.** Repository safety and Markdown whitespace checks pass. The README still identifies the project as development source with no playable distributed artifact.

## 2026-08-30 — G15 clean motion-runtime reproduction

- Re-copied the immutable pinned WiiCompiled runtime and Aurora sources into new output directories, applied every tracked iOS/Aurora patch in order, and configured a new arm64 iOS Simulator Ninja build without reusing the exercised Xcode product.
- The complete 853-step graph rebuilt all 29,065 base translated functions and linked `KartPadMotionSteering.mm`, CoreMotion, the exact SunPad component, SDL/UIKit, and Aurora/Metal. The resulting standalone `IOSSIMULATOR` executable has SHA-256 `06238bd24c37235524375b7a12fbb0ca522b156b51936bf5be97049f5da5e500` and only Apple system dependencies.
- The binary exports the motion, physical-controller, and SunPad Objective-C classes; the motion strings and patch-owned framework/source contracts are present. The twelve-file SunPad verifier remains byte-identical at `e43f0ea6b797e5110787171957c9dc3c6213269c`.
- Classification: **Pass for post-motion clean source/link reproducibility.** The Ninja bundle deliberately lacks Xcode's compiled `Assets.car`, so it is not substituted for the already package-audited and Simulator-exercised Xcode candidate. Physical motion play remains open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-motion-steering/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G10 honest Grand Prix retry and stale generated-state rejection

- Backed up installed KartPad state and launched an isolated portable run from the exact pre-all-cups save, preserving the fixture-derived installed save. The first run's live input telemetry printed `0.2`, proving that the ignored portable binary still contained the previously rejected `0.18` accessibility level even though tracked/prepared source was already restored to `0.35`.
- Stopped that run, rebuilt only the current runtime source and link, copied and ad-hoc signed the corrected portable app, restored the exact pre-fixture save hash `4c7b8d596bbef8160ddc24255539321d39c07996c1ade0fd2aa6f90c999a6cf6`, and retried with one changed variable. Live telemetry then printed the expected rounded `0.3` samples.
- The corrected run remained stable but bounded Computer Use keypresses could not maintain a continuous driving line. Its sole Luigi Circuit segment covered race time `240..8195` and never reached finish; private trace SHA-256 is `423598ddb67d139d5f73556463affa8cb21be6dbb117280cbe1f74c6d8e7ed03`.
- Classification: **Inconclusive for honest Grand Prix progression; no runtime regression.** The known-good portable save was restored at SHA-256 `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`, the app exited normally, no Simulator is booted, and another unchanged synthetic attempt is prohibited by the repeated-failure rule. G10 remains open for sustained physical-input progression and three-/four-player standings.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 exact native data and diagnostics menu checkpoint

- Built the exact post-commit package from source `5781b9950013f405e61018ecd4893401fd7f08a1`. Its signed executable SHA-256 is `a4620de0ae056ebcda44fc143f5d286288fe08e654f5e6ce04a0a6ad8b9b6a9c` and bundle-content hash is `dd7679fecdf4baaa89b59461d50fec7e24c57ab50b76e00bc83e2f24a7c87ba0`.
- The native Objective-C++ shell passed strict warnings-as-errors compilation; the pinned-source patch chain reproduced cleanly, the complete translated runtime relinked, and the strengthened package audit passed 20 consecutive runs.
- Exercised the exact package through macOS accessibility. The KartPad application menu exposed Show Data, Show Cache, and Save Diagnostics in normal menu order; Show Data opened the correct Application Support folder, and Save Diagnostics opened a native save panel.
- Saved the exact candidate's private bounded report at SHA-256 `4b9a7b860782aa0598701cefa95dd5a04df15f582f90b6b08dc6c50a92575ba9`. It contains only version/platform and yes/no storage-presence fields and explicitly omits paths, game data, save contents, credentials, and logs. KartPad closed normally and no Simulator was booted during the exercise.
- Classification: **Pass for native data/cache access and bounded diagnostics export; G13 remains open.** First-run WBFS/extracted-data setup, settings/controller mapping, richer runtime breadcrumbs, update-in-place, and clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-native-menu.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 native macOS settings persistence

- Replaced SDL's disabled application-menu Settings item with an enabled native AppKit panel for render scale, display mode, FPS visibility, master volume, and mute. The panel accurately states that changes apply on next launch and keeps controller mapping routed to the existing F10 settings bar.
- Exercised all five controls with 3×, borderless fullscreen, FPS off, 75% volume, and mute. The written config preserved the existing game-data path; a second isolated portable launch consumed every value, reported framebuffer scale 3, and initialized host audio at gain 0.
- Restored the live user config byte-for-byte to SHA-256 `3560325ff1a4509c76c99eb4aefedfa7d92f307b340ee4f4c79f10d8ec13b173`. The Cancel route preserved the same hash.
- Tightened the first visual candidate by removing excess panel height and moving the buttons to standard trailing alignment. Strict warnings-as-errors compilation, full runtime relink, package audit, and exact-candidate accessibility exercise pass.
- Exact source is `bed127fa4fed930cd730a858e870d20fa646378e`; signed executable SHA-256 is `3519452c6b03d505d1249c99e71f50f912e5bf5d4a4e952a6f6726ff70a0d0f9` and bundle-content hash is `5b0a47b251b84c9698580c06a39c4e9e7adc1576ba120274cd8a46f95dfb1ed1`. KartPad closed normally and no Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for native display/audio settings persistence; G13 remains open.** Native first-run game-data setup, controller-mapping shell entry, richer diagnostics, update-in-place, and clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-settings/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 native macOS first-run extracted-data gate

- Added a native gate before runtime initialization for packages without valid configured game data. It accepts an extracted folder through the system picker only after checking the required runtime surface, `RMCP01` PAL disc/revision header, Wii magic, and supported `main.dol` hash.
- The successful clean path wrote `paths.dvd_root`, reloaded the already initialized configuration cache, and reached the retail game in the same process with normal frame cadence and non-silent host audio. An unsupported folder produced bounded guidance and preserved the prior config byte-for-byte at SHA-256 `ef058e8898a4b827d41330a7fb20d018446fa39ae218d5dee37a6e6382d68573`.
- Added `Choose Game Data…` to the native application menu and constructed the complete standard About, Settings, Services, Hide, and Quit surface when first-run AppKit initialization prevents SDL from supplying it. The first menu-Quit attempt exposed a translated render-worker teardown failure; the accepted action now closes the Aurora window and uses its established direct successful-exit path. First-run Quit, configured menu Quit, and exact-candidate menu Quit all exit without a fatal report.
- Strict warnings-as-errors syntax compilation, exact pinned-patch reproduction, the full 29,065-function relink, signed package audit, and exact post-commit accessibility exercise pass. Exact source is `a5ee9fecc64ba14cdd5f1beb8609be955c435bd4`; signed executable SHA-256 is `67723c7341efce1fa6a999f21ce25cd6e1128a62d6a2f9e4950ee71c9fc42a6f` and bundle-content hash is `1874ae00de3f3ba66a675849875ca769e6edb5fd4edd8966bdcafa3dd96d4aca`. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for native extracted-data onboarding and reconfiguration; G13 remains open.** In-app WBFS extraction/translation, native controller-mapping entry, richer privacy-safe breadcrumbs, update-in-place, and clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-first-run/`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 native controller-settings entry

- Added `Controller Settings…` to the native application menu. It raises the retail window and posts the same F10 event consumed by the existing in-game overlay, retaining one controller-mapping implementation.
- The exact post-commit candidate opened the real top bar and its `Controller settings` entry over live retail rendering, toggled it closed from the native menu, continued gameplay, and exited normally through the safe Quit route.
- Strict warnings-as-errors compilation, full runtime relink, and signed package audit pass. Exact source is `ac892252977d07bfdd043672de160ef003d34aed`; signed executable SHA-256 is `803f5cc313c53053ce73b36bf76fae854b4f2cbab6ee984110bcad9fd85bc583` and bundle-content hash is `1c645a4a7d633cfc710bed23732eee018079edf937b4e5c7662bfef63bd1cd64`. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for native access to controller mapping; G13 remains open.** Richer privacy-safe runtime breadcrumbs, update-in-place, direct WBFS extraction/translation, and a clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-controller-menu.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 enriched privacy-safe macOS diagnostics

- Expanded the native report from storage-presence schema 1 to bounded schema 2 technical context: exact source/runtime identity, product profile, Metal backend, guest-memory/scheduler strategies, selected safe display/audio/network/controller values, supported-data validation, and yes/no storage health.
- Kept raw paths, game data, translated code, save contents, runtime log text, credentials, device identifiers, and signing material out of the report, and added an explicit user-review warning. The exact export is 890 bytes, has SHA-256 `b45a0a8b285b9adf1688f13f7229dd3d418b1e7ba88ff93a4d14433573a1f495`, and contains no absolute user/private path or key-like value.
- Unified native Show Data/Show Cache/diagnostics location resolution with the runtime's installed and portable path policy. Strict warnings-as-errors compilation, full runtime relink, signed package audit, exact-candidate save-panel export, and safe menu Quit pass.
- Exact source is `c6f94b7b075b652ca558beb0409a68fa28dbbd35`; signed executable SHA-256 is `c4102c2181c58de376419b3b784c8568b87a4f71d7b228f63cdb3dd462573504` and bundle-content hash is `2e3ba98e58cce0dc7a68d591d1dd5e423ccf9da6b836293a7a40228f56c11b8a`. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for richer bounded diagnostics context; G13 remains open.** Capped/redacted session tails and clean/unclean markers, update-in-place, direct WBFS extraction/translation, and clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-diagnostics-v2.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 macOS update-in-place state preservation

- Launched the older exact `a5ee9fe` package against an isolated installed-style home, loaded its configured extracted data, reached retail rendering with non-silent audio, and exited normally.
- Moved the old app aside as a recoverable rollback and copied the exact `c6f94b7` signed package into the same install path without touching Application Support or Caches. The updated package loaded the existing state, booted retail rendering/audio, exposed its newer controller/diagnostics menu, and exited normally.
- Across both launches and the bundle replacement, config remained SHA-256 `ef058e8898a4b827d41330a7fb20d018446fa39ae218d5dee37a6e6382d68573` and save remained SHA-256 `708c7a040e0cfe6cd815690e63f46d1678f17899bce0e786f7480030830f1d13`. Distinct old/new build-fingerprint hashes prove the executable bundle changed. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for local app-bundle update with external state preservation; G13 remains open.** Public/notarized updater infrastructure, downgrade migrations, capped/redacted session diagnostics, direct WBFS extraction/translation, and clean-clone self-build remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-update-in-place.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 clean macOS runtime rebuild and package exercise

- Repeated macOS preparation into a fresh disposable runtime source and object graph from current source `d54db68`. Both tracked patches applied afresh, the pinned `sse2neon` input verified at SHA-256 `44b9fa3d9dd92c4dcce7cdd4f2f76702e4fb14d7a5211da9a5086df180aa3bd9`, and all 857 configured build steps completed.
- The fail-closed packager/auditor produced signed executable SHA-256 `02ce2679b1b24c1da55bac2fd767dc423a227255f1efab074f913cfc739adb8c`, fingerprint SHA-256 `38f2129a646716149b3a39f0d3bfbc39219427fc6f9437140a3be3ab5aee88ec`, and bundle-content SHA-256 `840d0dca6027a4841665f9cfeea92b5dc4aa8c414127134cfa429982f07690a4`.
- Exercised an isolated copy through supported-data validation, Metal initialization, non-silent audio, retail Wii presentation at approximately 60 FPS, complete native menu inspection, and safe native Quit. The sole game process exited 0 with zero audio drops; no Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for fresh runtime source/object/package reproduction from the current checkout; G13 remains open.** The run reused ignored private translated title shards and extracted data, so direct WBFS extraction/translation and a true fresh-clone-to-generated-title build remain open. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-clean-rebuild.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 bounded macOS session diagnostics

- Added a persistent active-session marker and two-file structured rotation under external Application Support. A disposable forced exit preserved the marker; the next launch reported `previousSessionClean=no`. Native Quit writes `endedCleanly=yes`, removes the marker before Aurora's direct successful-exit path, and the following launch reports `previousSessionClean=yes`.
- Diagnostics schema 3 exports at most 4,096 bytes from each current/previous structured tail, replaces known personal path forms and the current username, warns that arbitrary text still requires review, and excludes private content and unbounded logs. The exact report is 1,366 bytes with SHA-256 `421a64fa8662bfcd948cc190b2b8d530dbffbf617e9da1103c51122fee9244d1`; its privacy scan passed.
- Exact source is `df98779114abd242ca56764e57c2b57977a09b5e`; signed executable SHA-256 is `c415f0397de0101ba1c6ee876f65c971c2ff9394c8a7c3f0a2da3cfd7c5e600e` and bundle-content SHA-256 is `893095ac96d66d036c61cbfa8af79b58eac3bdbf9d24b5da4fa44066111afcb6`. The exact package passed audit, retail launch, report export, clean Quit, clean-state relaunch, and a second clean Quit. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for bounded shared session breadcrumbs and clean/unclean markers; G13 remains open.** Direct WBFS/local generation, a true fresh-clone-to-generated-title self-build, and public updater/notarization infrastructure remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-session-diagnostics.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G13 real WBFS-to-macOS self-build workflow

- Added the public `self-build-macos.sh` workflow and explicit disc, translation, build, package, and audit stages. The disc stage accepts documented image extensions but fails closed on the supported full-image hash, pinned nodtool version, RMCP01/revision/Wii magic, and exact DOL/REL hashes; all extracted and generated content remains ignored/private.
- Ran the default path from the original read-only WBFS into fresh extraction and translation directories. The patched translator emitted 29,637 functions and 72 base shards with two workers. Fresh/prior function-tree hashes both equal `ded6953573bf8d2086ed02c45f9619d21772903b4a2ab6b26c5f77c4b3f738e6`; fresh/prior shard-source hashes both equal `79a984c8808e50927f5963106146619808c64a6c4b1f9c4495ac43f493ba9a9c`.
- A new 857-step macOS graph compiled and linked, then packaged and passed the fail-closed audit. The self-built app loaded the fresh extraction, reached live retail title/attract rendering at 60 FPS with non-silent audio, observed mapped A input, and exited 0 through native Quit with a clean session marker. No Simulator was booted.
- Exact committed workflow source is `d6e320295aa29303325908e9bd1f5cc9e756a15c`; its exact-fingerprint package independently reached the title/audio path and quit cleanly. Signed executable SHA-256 is `7982af482b0f4fa0fe522606de1d0493a3dc88a13384ef37d9d542f03de33a99` and bundle-content SHA-256 is `bc53f9e82e2e7656d86170e59426b9ab79b4553366946b684824739fd9f0fc92`.
- Classification: **Pass for the supported WBFS through private generation, complete macOS build, audited package, and runtime smoke; G13 remains open.** The exercise began from the current checkout with already present ignored reference pins/archives, not a fresh network Git clone. Automated source provisioning, native WBFS progress/resume/cache management, and public updater/notarization infrastructure remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g13-macos-wbfs-self-build.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 bounded presentation telemetry

- Extended Aurora's bounded one-second presentation snapshot with p50, p99,
  and worst intervals, then added content-free KartPad records every 300
  presents with effective-motion FPS and queued/created pipeline counts. A new
  strict parser rejects malformed/non-monotonic telemetry and passes its
  synthetic self-test.
- The first full build exposed an unrelated relative-path bug in the Mac
  preparation script. Canonicalizing caller-supplied translation/source/build
  paths and reconfiguring restored the translated header and data-section
  assembly edges; the complete 29,065-function runtime then linked.
- Exact source `2cfb7e161db8e3f4d69f658d163dcb8e3d242e6c` produced a package with
  bundle-content SHA-256
  `dc6ecdca64df7a031fde00ab63472f0130674e8705bd27196483d6a0005615de`.
  The title path emitted three valid windows with minimum effective FPS 59.001,
  maximum p99 17.701 ms, and maximum worst 32.808 ms while the pipeline queue
  fell from 1,223 to 865. Native Command-Q wrote a clean session and no
  Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for performance instrumentation, strict parsing, full
  compilation, exact package audit, live title telemetry, and clean shutdown;
  G11 remains open.** The short retained-cache run is not a controlled
  cold/warm pair, representative race, profile, or soak. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-present-telemetry.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 reversible title cache comparison

- Moved the complete six-file, 22 MiB regenerable KartPad cache into an ignored
  private backup, leaving saves/configuration and the exact `2cfb7e1` package
  unchanged. The pre-experiment cache tree SHA-256 was
  `8df42bdd8d909471e87491005ac69144edca7c0088b59bf0b33ec4449e9669c4`.
- The empty-cache title run recorded minimum effective FPS 51.958, maximum p99
  83.783 ms, maximum worst 85.094 ms, and 20 dropped audio blocks / 7,680 bytes.
  The queue reached zero and the run later stabilized near 60 FPS; that recovery
  does not erase the cold failure.
- The immediate warm relaunch recorded minimum effective FPS 59.963, maximum
  p99 17.264 ms, maximum worst 25.966 ms, zero queued pipelines from the first
  record, and zero audio drops through two telemetry intervals.
- Both runs exited cleanly. The generated experiment cache was retained under
  ignored `private/`, the original cache was restored, and its recomputed tree
  hash matched exactly. No Simulator was booted.
- Classification: **Pass for a reversible, controlled empty-cache/warm-cache
  title comparison; G11 remains open.** Cache state materially explains this
  title-path difference, but representative Luigi Circuit/Moonview Highway
  pairs, CPU/GPU profiles, sustained frame pacing, and the eight-hour soak
  remain. Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-present-telemetry.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 macOS pipeline-worker counterbalance

- Compared exact six-worker source `2cfb7e1` with exact one-worker source
  `64359cb` across reversible empty-application-cache legs. The one-worker
  candidate ranged from 55.460 to 59.868 minimum effective FPS and from 55.101
  to 16.990 ms maximum p99; six workers ranged from 52.000 to 59.974 minimum
  effective FPS and from 59.646 to 17.596 ms maximum p99.
- The final six-worker leg was the smoothest complete sample: 59.974 minimum
  effective FPS, 17.596 ms maximum p99, 18.016 ms worst, and zero audio drops.
  This followed prior Metal exercises despite an empty KartPad cache, proving
  that application-cache state alone does not define a true cold GPU start.
- Restored the original cache after every leg, retained generated caches and
  logs privately, closed normally, and kept no Simulator device booted. The
  original relative cache-tree hash remained
  `34fafbdcd96c978d025b1604cf2fe74e14f1561d9d8aa1ea647d929226c7c031`.
- Classification: **one-worker causality rejected; experimental default
  reverted; G11 remains open.** Next work is deterministic race profiling with
  explicit application and machine-level cache-state disclosure. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-pipeline-worker-sweep.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G10 three-player stationary timeout experiment

- Proved that repeated normal UI keyboard events can sustain acceleration;
  isolated accessibility taps were the earlier gap. Short feedback-guided
  steering pulses still did not provide a repeatable racing line, so the
  bounded Grand Prix calibration was exited without claiming completion.
- Registered three independent keyboard-backed Classic channels and launched a
  normal 100cc three-player Luigi Circuit VS race with Mario, Luigi, and Yoshi.
  All local racers remained stationary while the CPU field raced for about 310
  live seconds. The four panes held the retail 30 Hz cadence, but no FINISH,
  DNF timer, results, or standings transition occurred.
- Audio reached 29 dropped blocks / 11,136 bytes. Normal pause/quit and
  Command-Q wrote a clean session; the save remained byte-identical at SHA-256
  `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
- Classification: **stationary-player shortcut falsified; row 30 and
  three-player audio remain open.** At least one local finisher requires
  sustained physical input or a separately proven normal input-driving method.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g10-three-player-stationary-timeout.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 Moonview CPU/GPU profile and FPSR counterbalance

- A 30-second Time Profiler capture of stationary Moonview Highway sampled
  16.219 CPU-seconds. The main thread held 89.4%; `feclearexcept` and
  `fetestexcept` accounted for 37.6% and 8.8% of leaf time. A separate 20-second
  Metal System Trace measured 12.15% union KartPad GPU occupancy, no drawable
  waits, no warm shader compilation, and stable 545.39–545.42 MiB allocation.
- A direct arm64 FPSR experiment preserved the exact 250,227-check cross-arch
  hash, translated fixture, sanitized suites, and 579/579 translator tests. Its
  focused multiply benchmark improved 26.0%.
- The production counterbalance falsified the microbenchmark result: direct
  FPSR recorded 17.575 sampled CPU-seconds / 14.918 main-thread seconds versus
  17.392 / 14.719 for the original libc control. Both held 60 FPS. Samples
  moved from libc symbols into inlined PPC helpers, demonstrating that the
  serialized architectural access—not libc spelling—is the cost. The runtime
  experiment and benchmark were reverted.
- Static follow-up ranks translator data flow above more FPSR micro-tuning:
  the full graph has 43,649 stateful scalar FP call sites but only 12 explicit
  FPSCR observer/mutator sites across three of 106 shards. Any value-only
  lowering must be proven interprocedurally dead before observers, enabled
  exception behavior, and guest-state boundaries.
- Classification: **direct FPSR optimization rejected; G11 remains open.** Raw
  traces stay ignored/private, both packages audited and exited cleanly, and no
  Simulator was booted. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-moonview-profile.md` and
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-arm64-fpsr-experiment.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 FPSCR effect-model prerequisite

- Found that KartPad's stateful FP lowering updated `CpuContext.fpscr` at
  runtime while the inherited helper-effect catalog still classified those IR
  helpers as pure. That made ABI and architectural liveness summaries blind to
  hidden FPSCR input/output and made any dead-state optimization unsound.
- Added explicit FPSCR read/write effects for scalar, No-NI, paired,
  comparison, move, and exception-control helpers, and taught both ABI and
  state-liveness analysis to consume them. Unknown calls remain conservative
  full-context boundaries.
- Rebuilt the patch from immutable upstream, updated the checked translated
  fixture for the now-precise non-boundary helpers, and retained checked-memory
  fallback coverage for resolved ranges. The full arm64/x86 differential,
  translated fixture, ASan/UBSan passes, Dolphin oracle, and 582/582 translator
  tests pass with unchanged hash `0xccd5757c4c0643d4` and FPSCR `0xe7991393`.
- Classification: **correctness prerequisite accepted; no runtime speedup is
  claimed yet; G11 remains open.** The next full-title generation will measure
  how many false full-context fences disappear before any FPSCR elision is
  considered.
- Full-title follow-up regenerated 29,637 functions (1,093 emitted files
  changed), built/audited exact package `2282e2c`, and ran a back-to-back
  title attract-race Time Profiler counterbalance against exact `2cfb7e1`.
  Candidate/control sampled CPU was 10.432/10.813 seconds, but candidate/control
  main-thread time was 7.527/7.402 seconds. Both held 60 FPS with zero audio
  drops and clean exits. The mixed result is **neutral**, not a performance
  win; the correctness model remains accepted and G11 remains open.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 current-core iPad race profile

- Built the latest full FPSCR-effect-model graph as an audited IOSSIMULATOR app
  from source `443fd69`; executable SHA-256 is
  `08eafccd48a9e412bf133a55aed221d252bcd14c46c9ac5f4b44596fe2c669d7`.
- Proved the exact SunPad `Show FPS Counter` preference now turns the runtime
  overlay off and on immediately without relaunching. The exact copied snapshot
  remains byte-identical; KartPad refreshes the preference in its patch layer.
- Touch-navigated a normal twelve-racer 50cc Luigi Circuit Grand Prix. Across
  35 live-race telemetry records, effective FPS remained 57.003–60.082, maximum
  p99 was 19.767 ms, and the final record was 60.004 FPS / 16.765 ms p99.
- Countered the repeated-frame ambiguity: the retail race clock advanced from
  01:11.278 to 01:21.893 across a roughly ten-second wall-clock bracket, so the
  stationary guest was advancing in real time rather than only presenting at
  60 Hz.
- A paired 20-second CPU sample retained floating-point exception bookkeeping
  as the dominant leaf cost, but direct fenv leaves fell from 6,132 to 4,160
  samples while `RuntimeMain` moved from 11,098 to 10,689. This is promising
  reproduction evidence, not a claimed optimization. Physical footprint moved
  from 710.6 to 700.8 MiB.
- Classification: **Pass for current-core Simulator packaging, live settings,
  real-time stationary-race cadence, telemetry, profiling, and clean shutdown;
  physical-device and complete touch-race acceptance remain open.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-ipad-current-race-profile.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 live mobile display settings

- Found that SunPad's aspect-ratio and render-resolution actions do not say
  restart required, but KartPad sampled both only at launch. Extended the
  KartPad-owned host bridge without changing the exact copied SunPad files.
- The full runtime patch stack applies from immutable upstream. Both Ninja and
  Xcode incremental builds link, and the strict IOSSIMULATOR app audit passes;
  executable SHA-256 is
  `bdb805b933e9cbce3e921dba11063af18fd6b18eaebdb36c447bbae24f71f2d8`.
- In one iPad Simulator process, 4:3 switched visibly to fixed 16:9 and back,
  and native resolution switched to 2x and back. Runtime records captured the
  exact `0 -> 1 -> 0` aspect and `1 -> 2 -> 1` scale transitions.
- Steady state remains cheap: surface size and aspect are reconfigured only
  when the aspect choice changes; framebuffer scale is updated only when the
  scale changes. The app exited cleanly and the sole Simulator was shut down.
- Classification: **Pass for live aspect/resolution menu semantics and exact
  SunPad preservation; physical-device visual/performance acceptance remains
  open.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-ipad-current-race-profile.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G14 honest inherited experiments

- Traced SunPad's restart-required experiments to Sunshine-specific runtime
  features: a 90% emulated CPU clock and a GMSE01 60 FPS patch. KartPad's AOT
  Mario Kart Wii runtime implements neither, so the inherited actions were
  silently persisting settings they could not affect.
- Kept the exact visible action titles/icons and the byte-identical SunPad
  snapshot. KartPad's existing wrapper now replaces only their handlers with
  explicit `Unavailable in KartPad` explanations and never changes either
  preference.
- The Xcode app rebuild and strict IOSSIMULATOR audit pass; executable SHA-256
  is `0459d6948e856547dcbe77f7b1839ff7882a8cf73cb0c3052c5c53ff99e98d90`.
  Both alerts were exercised above live rendering, neither defaults key was
  created, and the sole Simulator shut down cleanly.
- Classification: **Pass for honest experimental-menu behavior; no performance
  gain is claimed.** KartPad performance remains governed by measured frame
  pacing and the profiled AOT runtime rather than an incompatible SunPad clock
  switch. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g14-ipad-current-race-profile.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — G11 interrupted macOS soak and audio-pressure finding

- Started an exact, audited `2282e2c` macOS candidate under the strict
  minute-sample soak monitor. The trace covered 15,010 seconds with a maximum
  61-second sample gap before the operator stopped the visible runtimes. The
  Simulator shell had been left open even though `simctl` consistently showed
  zero booted devices; that failed the user's one-visible-runtime expectation.
- The partial memory trace ranged from 257,120 to 1,125,792 KiB and repeatedly
  returned to low-water states. Its post-15-minute slope was -137,681.6
  KiB/hour over 236 samples; threads remained between 23 and 28. This strongly
  contradicts monotonic growth for the sampled duration but cannot replace the
  missing eight-hour leak/end-state evidence.
- Audio submitted 1,934,438,016 bytes through 5,038,080 queue checks with zero
  empty-before-push observations, but dropped 480 blocks / 184,320 bytes in
  bursts around scene exits. Some bursts coincided with pipeline compilation
  and 137--154 ms frame stalls; others did not, isolating the fixed 120 ms
  maximum queue as insufficient for broader transition pressure.
- The save remained byte-identical at SHA-256
  `ad79c24bc5eb0ba6bc8cd2836a55680621892b578a04ea49d8884a71a42c563a`.
  Classification: **interrupted diagnostic; fail for audio and not an
  eight-hour soak pass.** Next work is a bounded queue-cap counterbalance,
  followed by a fresh single-visible-runtime soak. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g11-interrupted-macos-soak.md`.

## 2026-08-30 — macOS controls convergence

- Reprioritized away from the eight-hour macOS soak toward the practical
  three-platform finish line requested by the product owner: native Mac
  controls, then one-at-a-time iPhone and iPad verification.
- Added a native **Controls…** panel to the KartPad application menu. The panel
  exposes the complete Player 1 keyboard scheme, controller-remapping path,
  Players 2–4 guidance, and F10 runtime-settings shortcut without covering the
  game window.
- Completed the Classic keyboard surface with Left Shift → L/item and Tab →
  minus/select. Existing steering, accelerate, brake/reverse, drift, D-pad,
  Start, X/Y, and ZL/ZR bindings remain intact.
- The candidate compiled and linked, its source patch applied cleanly to the
  immutable runtime pin in dry-run mode, and the signed package passed the
  strengthened native-shell audit. Unsigned executable SHA-256 is
  `162007d4be078232c5f91707a193a313f3daebd2ec58578c8d90db0fdf84d4f3`;
  audited bundle-content SHA-256 is
  `5fbc01bf36428c4611358cc7d24e023fe168ec4b3ff203b9f4d8b9bcac77dff4`.
- With zero Simulator process and zero booted device, the sole Mac candidate
  opened normally at 60 FPS. The native menu exposed **Controls…**, its full
  panel fit cleanly in dark mode with every row visible, and the clean
  application-menu Quit path closed the only runtime. No Simulator was opened.

## 2026-08-30 — Mario Kart touch-control adaptation

- Kept the pinned twelve-file SunPad snapshot byte-identical and implemented
  the requested game-specific behavior in KartPad's owning overlay layer.
- Replaced Sunshine's wide analog-pressure R presentation and semantics with a
  compact digital Classic R button whose geometry matches L. Any nonzero touch
  pressure now publishes a full digital R press, and release clears it.
- Added an explicit sustained-acceleration state to A. SunPad's unchanged
  mixer continues to assert A from touch-down until touch-up; after one
  uninterrupted second KartPad turns the button cyan, adds a light haptic and
  exposes `Acceleration held` to accessibility. Touch-up, cancellation,
  backgrounding, and overlay removal all restore the normal state.
- The deterministic Classic input adapter passes and the strengthened package
  audit proves both touch contracts. The complete Simulator executable is
  `653943e6cfd1e965c70f743ede11fe464dadf3c752afdbe2ec7b3454ad9f631e`.
- Booted only the preserved iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. R rendered as the same
  compact pill as L. A changed from green to cyan after the test hook's
  one-second uninterrupted hold, exposed the held accessibility value, and
  returned to green after release. The hook invokes only KartPad's visual
  callbacks and cannot publish gameplay input. KartPad was terminated and the
  iPhone and Simulator shell were shut down; zero runtimes remain.
- Classification: **Pass for implementation, automated input mapping, package
  audit, and iPhone visual/accessibility behavior.** Hands-on physical touch
  feel remains external.
- After the pushed iPhone checkpoint, booted only the preserved iPad Pro
  13-inch Simulator with the same audited executable. In the requested
  landscape scene, R and L rendered as matching compact pills while live retail
  rendering continued. The isolated visual hook then changed A from green to
  cyan, exposed `Acceleration held`, and returned both appearance and
  accessibility state to normal after release. Terminated KartPad, shut down
  the iPad, and closed Simulator; zero runtimes remain.
- Classification addendum: **Pass for sequential iPad layout, held-state, and
  release-state verification on the exact iPhone-tested binary.**

## 2026-08-30 — End-to-end held-acceleration input proof

- Tightened the prior visual proof into a Simulator-only input-boundary probe.
  The opt-in hook dispatches the real A control's existing SunPad touch-down
  and touch-up actions, samples the shared mixer through KartPad's Classic
  adapter after 1.1 seconds, and publishes only bounded pass/fail breadcrumbs.
- Rebuilt and audited the complete arm64 IOSSIMULATOR application at executable
  SHA-256
  `7c3c6a4ddda8a2d89d42e4a867dfc6c1e43aadd4635c28a2870e302e525956be`.
  The exact SunPad verifier and focused Classic adapter suite still pass.
- Booted only the preserved iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. In the live runtime, the
  probe observed held Classic buttons `0x00000010` after the full one-second
  interval and released buttons `0x00000000` after touch-up. The A
  accessibility hint independently reported `Input self-test passed`.
- Terminated KartPad, shut down the iPhone, and closed Simulator. Zero game or
  Simulator runtimes remain.
- Classification: **Pass for the requested gameplay-input hold and release
  semantics, not merely their visual treatment.** The opt-in probe is compiled
  out of physical-iOS builds and the package audit rejects it on that target.

## 2026-08-30 — Physical-iOS touch-host compile boundary

- Added `scripts/check-ios-device-runtime-host.sh` so the exact UIKit host used
  by the full Simulator game is compiled again against the physical
  `iphoneos` SDK rather than treating preprocessor inspection as evidence.
- The script reuses the full game's resolved Objective-C++ include/define
  response, changes only the Apple target/sysroot, requires an arm64 `IOS`
  16.0 object, and rejects all three Simulator-only test contracts by string.
- The current host compiles at SHA-256
  `58df58a0577dd6c3276ec67c93bbf67955c6e1531a3912323cbb5881b72d4a55`.
  The unsigned physical-device shell also rebuilt and passed its IOS package
  audit; executable SHA-256 is
  `574a1d874cb9b889c6ee7ff4c7c16e64115abdcb605ffd37291c632d7e841ee2`.
- No Simulator or game runtime was launched. Classification: **Pass for exact
  modified-host compilation, conditional probe exclusion, and the independent
  physical-device shell/package boundary.** This is not a full translated
  physical-device link, signed install, or hardware execution claim.

## 2026-08-30 — Full translated physical-iOS application

- Located and verified the already pinned physical-iOS Dawn package at SHA-256
  `a361fcca75929fa5c766cfcde979c010a6da7d805e5db8e15c75e73fd8260e78`;
  a representative archive object declares platform `IOS`, minimum 14.0.
- Configured the current integrated mobile source against `iphoneos` 16.0 and
  the same private 29,065-function base translation used by the accepted
  Simulator candidate. The complete Xcode graph compiled Aurora/Metal, SDL
  UIKit/CoreAudio, the static runtime, the exact SunPad component, KartPad's
  touch/motion/controller host, and every translated shard, then linked.
- The 75 MiB unsigned app declares arm64 `IOS` 16.0 and links only Apple system
  frameworks/libraries. The strict full-game audit passes, including original
  icon/privacy/runtime resources, required mobile symbols and touch contracts,
  forbidden private data, and absence of all Simulator-only probes. Executable
  SHA-256 is
  `54458302a273c2f93955f3ee9c8558e54456c8578439d50fd3651cb52cf17711`.
- Added `scripts/build-ios-device-game-app.sh`; its immediate incremental rerun
  reconfigured, built, audited, and reproduced the same executable hash.
- No Simulator or game runtime was launched. Classification: **Pass for full
  translated physical-iOS compilation, link, bundle resolution, audit, and
  reproducible incremental build.** Signing, installation, and physical-device
  runtime acceptance remain external and are not claimed.

## 2026-08-30 — Clean mobile source and physical-device reproduction

- Started from new mobile source, Simulator-build, and physical-device Xcode
  directories. The first compile stopped honestly at step 757/853: the
  serialized full-file KPAD patch declared 765 output lines but contained 767,
  so traditional `patch` silently omitted the fixture function's final return
  and brace and the following unity source was parsed inside its linkage block.
- Corrected the tracked hunk header to 767 lines, independently applied it to a
  new pinned-runtime copy, and verified the generated KPAD source ends with the
  complete function. The resumed clean Simulator graph compiled and linked all
  29,065 translated functions as a standalone link at executable SHA-256
  `db5be50d55916fd9bd9ed8be7dbee7fb7885edc21380687d8dc4cf9bef563cf1`.
  That Ninja bundle retains unresolved Xcode Info.plist variables and lacks
  `Assets.car`, so it is not claimed as installable or package-audited.
- From that corrected clean source, configured a separate `iphoneos` Xcode
  directory against the pinned physical Dawn archive. The 29,065-function
  graph compiled, linked, and passed the strict `IOS` audit at executable
  SHA-256
  `3e201daca7591a2bcadc3e28a4ad45565ac0813b2138ff57abad7690aaef8c4f`.
  An immediate incremental script rerun reproduced the same executable hash.
  The compiled icon catalog remains `d25540efa70a7c9f6ef8d12849a6469ea8e7ff2c5cbe9477c9e7513c640b2434`
  and the privacy manifest remains
  `343dbc92a22d95a896d5bb894f439d655ac8e15d0fcc7fe72500bd5fcaba1740`.
- No Simulator device or game runtime was launched; zero devices remain
  booted. Classification: **Pass for corrected patch-stack reproduction,
  fresh full Simulator code linking, and fresh full physical-iOS compilation
  and audit.** Signing, installation, and hands-on hardware acceptance remain
  external.

## 2026-08-30 — Fail-fast patch-stack integrity

- Added `scripts/verify-patch-hunks.py` to `verify-sources.sh`. It validates
  every unified-diff hunk's declared old/new counts and rejects trailing body
  lines outside a declared hunk, moving this failure class from late compile
  time to the initial source gate.
- The first run found the already corrected KPAD undercount and count defects
  in six older patches. Corrected only their hunk metadata; all 174
  hunks across 13 patches now pass. A fresh disposable runtime accepted the
  complete Aurora/mobile patch chain, and its KPAD and Aurora presentation
  sources are byte-identical to the successful clean build source. The FPSCR
  translator patch reapplied and its Release CLI rebuilt with zero warnings or
  errors.
- Removed only reproducible untracked `.o`, `.d`, generated-header, and local
  tool outputs from the pinned `wiimms-iso-tools` reference checkout; no
  tracked source or private input changed. Full pin/input verification and the
  repository safety audit then passed. Classification: **Pass for fail-fast
  patch metadata, clean pinned sources, and patch-chain reproduction.**

## 2026-08-30 — Touch-modal held-input clearing

- A live iPhone Simulator check opened the compact KartPad three-dot menu and
  its lower Touch Control Settings action over retail rendering. Computer Use
  keyboard navigation reached the lower menu rows, but its pointer drags did
  not become finger swipes inside the embedded settings scroll view; direct
  Move/Reset-row automation is therefore inconclusive rather than accepted.
- Kept the twelve-file SunPad snapshot byte-identical and overrode only the
  owning KartPad subclass's settings toggle. Opening or closing Touch Control
  Settings now clears the complete touch mixer contribution and restores the A
  button's normal appearance.
- A Simulator-only boundary probe published the real A control, observed held
  Classic buttons `0x00000010`, opened the actual settings path, and observed
  released buttons `0x00000000`. The menu then exposed `Touch settings
  input-clear self-test passed`, and live controls returned normally.
- The full Simulator app rebuilt/audited at SHA-256
  `de7d46bd5bd2c55c7b40acbeac1d4013aa800a5d2b086cf36dfaf2d88e218acb`.
  The full physical-iOS app rebuilt/audited at SHA-256
  `f8ed5777817894fffd84e0330659240e2e10731b072d2c60b0df3b1701db9375`;
  its audit rejects the Simulator-only hook. The sole iPhone and app were
  terminated and shut down; zero runtimes remain. Classification: **Pass for
  touch-modal held-input clearing and cross-target compilation; lower-row
  editor/reset UI automation remains inconclusive.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-touch-modal-input-clear/`.

## 2026-08-30 — Touch layout editor and reset

- Reused the exact SunPad settings/editor behavior while keeping its pinned
  twelve-file snapshot unchanged. A Simulator-only owner-layer probe opens the
  actual settings panel at its lower scroll position and is excluded from
  physical builds by compilation plus package audit.
- The real Move switch's value-change action entered edit mode. It selected A,
  changed the real per-control slider to `1.25`, persisted
  `SunPadControlSizeScales = { A = 1.25; }`, exposed Done through
  accessibility, and exited cleanly when Done was invoked. Runtime evidence
  reported `move/resize pass (A=1.25)`.
- A separate bounded run seeded one test A origin, invoked the real Reset This
  Device Layout button, displayed the native destructive confirmation, and
  confirmed Reset through accessibility. The position, per-control-size,
  global-size, and opacity preference keys were all absent afterward. A normal
  relaunch restored the default A geometry over live retail rendering.
- The full Simulator app rebuilt/audited at executable SHA-256
  `cbea21a728182be320d18d14d681248f4433e50f0617ac0c5bb731efecac2a34`.
  The full physical-iOS app rebuilt/audited at executable SHA-256
  `cf1d4ccdb20b52d52231b272b1538896ead972fdc18096fcae766d4497416e00`
  and contains no Simulator test contract. The sole app and Simulator were
  terminated and shut down. Classification: **Pass for editor entry,
  selection, resize, persistence, Done, reset confirmation, reset semantics,
  and default restoration.** Physical finger-drag ergonomics remain hands-on.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-touch-layout-editor/`.

## 2026-08-30 — Native iOS WBFS DiscIO feasibility

- Compiled pinned Dolphin DiscIO for arm64 iOS Simulator after replacing the
  unavailable desktop-only filesystem watcher, USB adapter, AppKit/IOKit, and
  Quartz paths with bounded iOS behavior. Disabled curl's false-positive
  `pipe2` path for the Apple SDK. The immutable reference checkout was restored
  clean after serializing every change into verified patches.
- Ran a minimal native probe against an APFS clone of the supplied read-only
  WBFS on exactly one iPhone 17 Pro Simulator. It identified `RMCP01` revision
  0, enumerated 2,095 filesystem entries, exported the disc system data, and
  reproduced `main.dol` SHA-256
  `80d18895b39c63bd80f457398bfcbb91b7d16ac116a41a88967e954080155b05`.
- Repeated the test from the clean pinned build rather than relying on the
  SunPad reference binary. Its executable SHA-256 is
  `acac0a73fa04085fe9d9f8eac80ab13183d7d25999f1489511173b96e6e10984`.
  The Simulator trap shut down the sole device and its temporary 2.6 GB clone
  disappeared with the Simulator staging directory; zero devices remain
  booted.
- Added a fresh-source build script, probe source, and content-private evidence.
  Classification: **Pass for native WBFS open/identity/filesystem/system-export
  feasibility.** Full file-tree extraction and atomic integration into the
  existing KartPad mobile import flow remain open. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-ios-wbfs-discio/`.

## 2026-08-30 — Native WBFS first launch and physical-acceptance handoff

- Integrated pinned Dolphin DiscIO as a narrow iOS importer without linking
  Dolphin's execution core into KartPad. The iOS package audit now requires the
  WBFS import/error contract and rejects JIT, JitInterface, and cached-
  interpreter symbols.
- On one disposable no-data iPhone Simulator, selected the user's read-only
  supported WBFS through the real first-launch path. KartPad extracted and
  atomically activated the full 2.5 GiB/2,043-file tree, reproduced the accepted
  DOL and StaticR hashes, continued into retail rendering in the same process,
  accepted touch A, and reached the title on warm relaunch.
- The physical-controller suite passed stable Player 1–4 assignment and stale-
  input clearing. The exact SunPad owner behavior clears/hides touch when the
  first real controller takes Player 1 and restores touch on disconnect; the
  reference deliberately leaves touch visible for Simulator controllers, so
  takeover feel is reserved for hardware acceptance.
- Built the pinned DiscIO graph for `iphoneos`, then compiled all 29,065
  translated functions into the complete unsigned arm64 `IOS` 16.0 app. The
  strengthened audit passed at executable SHA-256
  `b02c1c94dee58526169a08e73bbbe671e6f6ee31c1870517ef244e2651e9de92`;
  icon `Assets.car` and privacy manifest hashes remain
  `18de0779809a419002a50074b1d9e45e83aa89dfaa4e4355e8ed26c45c7fb346`
  and `343dbc92a22d95a896d5bb894f439d655ac8e15d0fcc7fe72500bd5fcaba1740`.
- No device app was signed, installed, or launched. The disposable Simulator
  was deleted, zero Simulators remain booted, and the user's preserved
  Simulator data was untouched. Classification: **Ready for sequential
  physical iPad then iPhone acceptance.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-08-30/g15-native-wbfs-import/` and
  `docs/PHYSICAL-ACCEPTANCE.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A0 source-only shell

- Started from clean `origin/main` commit
  `8432a7f32f34b286653cde34f8977570756816b8` on the authorized second Apple
  Silicon host. Added a hash-pinned explicit bootstrap for ARM64 Temurin 17,
  Android command-line tools, SDK 36, Build Tools 36.0.0, NDK 29, CMake,
  emulator, and the API 36 / Android 15 16 KiB ARM64 images; the ordinary
  validator and build do not install software or accept terms.
- Added the non-playable Gradle/SDLActivity application, transparent
  KartPad-owned View overlay, ARM64 `libmain.so`, SDL/JNI entry, and a
  source-only Dawn Vulkan-adapter fixture. SDL3 Android and Dawn downloads are
  hash/size verified. Dawn's pinned Linux-CI `liblog.so` path is rewritten to
  logical `log`, remaining CI SDK paths are rejected, and the sanitized CMake
  metadata digest is locked.
- The local debug APK builds and passes its SDK/package, ARM64-only library,
  16 KiB ZIP/ELF alignment, dependency, RELRO, non-executable-stack, and
  privacy audit. Its SHA-256 is
  `c28461e09f78ba2dc05ab70d137d1918d2e559c9ec2864ae645d26f3697e22ee`.
- Cold-boot execution passes on `KartPad_API_36_ARM64` at API 36 / 4,096-byte
  pages and `KartPad_API_35_PS16K_ARM64` at API 35 / 16,384-byte pages. Each
  reports one Dawn Vulkan adapter through the emulator's gfxstream/lavapipe
  path. An initial 16 KiB 30-second marker timeout passed unchanged on retry;
  the recorded runner now uses a 60-second bound and wider failure diagnostics.
- Classification: **A0 pass for public toolchain/bootstrap, source-only build
  and audit, SDL/JNI entry, Dawn Vulkan adapter discovery, and 4 KiB/16 KiB
  emulator execution.** This is not presented-frame, lifecycle, native-runtime,
  gameplay, physical-device, performance, or release evidence. No APK/AAB was
  hosted or published. Continue A1 with deterministic Vulkan
  clear/readback/present and lifecycle, guest-memory, and scheduler fixtures.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a0-source-only-fixture.md`.
- The repository-wide `scripts/verify-sources.sh` validated all 335 patch hunks
  plus WiiCompiled, SunPad, and WheelWizard, then stopped because the ignored,
  clean `rr-pulsar` checkout's HEAD is newer than the dependency lock. The
  locked commit object and its exact locked tree remain present and its push
  URL is disabled; the checkout was intentionally left untouched. This does
  not affect A0, which uses only the independently hash-verified SDL3 and Dawn
  downloads. The SunPad snapshot and repository safety checks pass.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A1 deterministic Vulkan readback and present

- Extended the source-only fixture from adapter discovery to one real Dawn
  Vulkan device. It clears a 4×4 RGBA8 texture, copies through a WebGPU buffer
  with the required 256-byte row pitch, maps it, and verifies every pixel as
  `20-80-e0-ff`.
- Built a WebGPU surface directly from SDL's Android native-window property,
  cleared and presented its current texture, drove the app HOME, observed the
  SDL background boundary through the required event filter, allowed Android
  surface teardown to settle, resumed, and presented through the replacement
  surface. The exact run passes on API 36 / 4 KiB and API 35 / 16 KiB ARM64
  cold-boot AVDs.
- The initial presentation attempt tried to create a second Dawn device and
  failed at that exact step. Sharing the intended single device fixed it. A
  separate startup race came from SDL translating its desktop `RESIZABLE` flag
  into an Android orientation request; removing that flag keeps SDL aligned
  with the sensor-landscape manifest. Waiting for `onStop` teardown before
  foreground avoids a second activity overlap.
- The audited local debug APK SHA-256 is
  `151397d104723415d4db9663f4a4566f3d769d42708d600ec417ea5525fa846f`.
  Classification: **Pass for deterministic Dawn Vulkan GPU clear/readback,
  Android surface clear/present, and one background/foreground surface
  recreation on both emulator page sizes.** A1 remains open for rotation,
  repeated stress, guest memory, and scheduler/register fixtures. No package
  was hosted or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a1-vulkan-readback-present.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A1 dynamic guest-memory aliases

- Added an Android-native, source-only memory fixture using
  `ASharedMemory_create`. It reserves a dynamic sparse 4 GiB `PROT_NONE`
  address range without a fixed high-address assumption, replaces a centered
  two-page span with a shared primary mapping, and creates a second shared
  alias of the same file descriptor.
- Filled the primary mapping with deterministic bytes and verified every byte
  through the secondary alias. Changed the primary to read-only, wrote through
  the secondary alias, observed the update through the primary, cycled the
  primary through `PROT_NONE` and back to read-only, and verified that data was
  preserved. The fixture never requests executable permission.
- Cold-boot combined runs pass on API 36 / 4,096-byte pages and API 35 /
  16,384-byte pages while retaining the existing Vulkan readback, initial
  presentation, and HOME/foreground replacement-surface checks. The audited
  local debug APK is 33,540,035 bytes with SHA-256
  `b9401bfb23c50a8256d6ef336c99085159d403873cf508a759d389e7f64e0635`.
- Classification: **Pass for dynamic 4 GiB reservation, shared alias
  visibility, and page-size-aware protection changes on both pinned emulator
  lanes.** This is not the production checked-memory implementation, scheduler
  evidence, physical-device evidence, gameplay, or performance. A1 remains
  open for rotation/repeated lifecycle and ELF AArch64 scheduler/register
  stress. No package was hosted or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a1-guest-memory.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A1 rotation and repeated surface lifecycle

- Changed the Vulkan fixture to retain and reconfigure its Dawn surface when
  Android changes the existing `SurfaceView`, and to release/create a new Dawn
  surface only after Android has actually destroyed and recreated the native
  surface. This matches the ownership boundary needed by the product.
- The runner enables the physical emulator accelerometer, sets an absolute
  flipped-landscape gravity vector, and requires SDL's exact orientation
  transition from landscape `1` to flipped landscape `2`. It then requires a
  successful retained-surface presentation followed by three separate HOME /
  foreground replacement-surface presentations. Every pass marker is rejected
  if the fixture emitted any error-level line.
- A naive user-rotation setting produced no sensor event and was rejected. The
  first physical-sensor implementation attempted to create a new Dawn surface
  from a `SurfaceView` changed in place; Dawn rejected its capabilities. The
  retained-surface model fixes that ownership error and passes cold boots on
  API 36 / 4 KiB and API 35 / 16 KiB.
- The audited local debug APK is 33,545,363 bytes with SHA-256
  `f2efa7efd850d41fe5bb4b19e0d2d448ade8ee3a4f82f58397c63665cdfe2e70`.
  Classification: **Pass for flipped-landscape reconfiguration and three
  consecutive background/foreground native-surface replacements on both
  pinned emulator page sizes.** Physical OEM lifecycle behavior, gameplay,
  performance, and long-session stability remain open. A1 now requires only
  the ELF AArch64 scheduler/register stress fixture. No package was hosted or
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a1-lifecycle-stress.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A1 ELF AArch64 scheduler and register stress

- Linked KartPad's accepted portable `GuestScheduler` directly into the
  Android native library and exercised start/resume, yield/exit, logical
  sleep/alarm wake, join, and cancellation. Two independent million-operation
  runs each reproduce the accepted state hash `0x7287563387fb1677` with exact
  four-thread distribution, VI cadence, GPR/FPR/SIMD/FPSCR state, and nested
  scheduler transitions.
- Added a small Android ELF AArch64 context-switch wrapper sharing the Apple
  register contract while using ELF symbol rules. One million real stack
  switches preserve x19–x29, use x30/SP to resume exact control flow, preserve
  d8–d15, and explicitly preserve FPCR/FPSR. The register fiber has its own
  aligned 64 KiB stack and cannot fall through after completion.
- The exact combined cold-boot fixture passes on API 36 / 4 KiB and API 35 /
  16 KiB while retaining the guest-memory, deterministic GPU readback,
  flipped-landscape, and five-generation surface checks. The audited local
  debug APK is 33,673,035 bytes with SHA-256
  `0846efc7058a5cae61ace508c9bdddd3b214c826275925164c148ba1e8b511b0`.
- Classification: **A1 pass on both pinned ARM64 emulator lanes.** This closes
  the source-only memory, scheduler/fiber, Vulkan, rotation, and bounded
  lifecycle gate. It is not production-runtime, gameplay, physical-driver,
  or performance evidence. A2 is next. No package was hosted or published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a1-elf-scheduler.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 complete Original runtime link

- Prepared a disposable WiiCompiled source tree from the existing ordered
  mobile patch stack, then added narrow Android CMake, shared-memory, ELF fiber,
  SDL entry, Crypto++, and object-format adaptations. The production Android
  fiber preserves x19-x29, x30/SP, d8-d15, FPCR, and FPSR.
- Compiled all 29,065 functions in the ignored Original translation graph and
  linked `libmain.so`. Older private registration shards are profile-labeled in
  the build directory, leaving the translator-owned inputs unchanged.
- Replaced Aurora's unexported SDL-internal activity mutex dependency with a
  KartPad-owned Java/native surface mutation lock. The normal source-only
  fixture still builds because it exports matching no-op hooks.
- The Gradle game-runtime mode produced a 103,425,387-byte local debug APK with
  SHA-256 `5d96c31ef91ead5d7ada0977c1853d39b4fcc7f57ea8f4fe3439c1de89ac9e13`.
  Its stripped 83,529,560-byte `libmain.so` has SHA-256
  `a1b15ee74f77fd891f7d885c6602bf23bd73c9b6e4cfcfc56ce1ee2279089165`.
  The strict package audit passes, including 16 KiB alignment and local/private
  path rejection. No APK/AAB was published.
- Classification: **Pass for A2 private Original compile/link/Gradle package
  integration only.** No game data is packaged or staged, and no boot,
  gameplay, controller, audio, save/relaunch, game lifecycle, or physical
  Android acceptance is claimed. A2 remains open for app-private paths and the
  gameplay matrix. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-original-runtime-link.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 app-private runtime initialization

- Added an exact 14-file public runtime-resource asset allowlist and a
  versioned staging/rename installer that runs before SDL loads. Fixture mode
  remains asset-free, and the package audit rejects any unexpected game-mode
  asset.
- Routed native configuration, logs, NAND, and mutable renderer caches through
  the Activity's Context-derived app-private files/cache directories. The
  first attempt called SDL's Android path helper from `libmain.so` static
  initialization and aborted with a null SDL JNI class; exporting the exact
  directories before `SDLActivity.onCreate` removes that load cycle.
- The next run exposed a production-memory defect hidden by the source-only
  fixture: Android shared memory is already sized by `ASharedMemory_create`, so
  a redundant POSIX `ftruncate` failed with `EINVAL`. Skipping that resize only
  on Android preserves the accepted alias/protection model.
- A cleared API 36 / 4 KiB launch now installs all resources, initializes the
  4 GiB guest map, loads the complete translated image, executes 43 main-DOL
  and 192 StaticR constructors, creates Vulkan/Aurora, seeds 1,199 public
  pipeline rows, creates only app-private writable databases/NAND/log paths,
  and fails closed with `No DVD root is configured`. The accepted 103,429,792-
  byte APK has SHA-256
  `49526a79b60bdc0f1b3ca51202f4b95c12b2fef3329a552a125a63f1863011c2`;
  the default fixture rebuild/audit also passes at
  `dcc02c1b618e1de4e32b135ff058159eadbd9632a19e74b9a64384de18c3128b`.
- Classification: **Pass for A2 app-private runtime initialization without
  game data.** No game boot/gameplay or physical-device result is claimed and
  no APK/AAB was published. Continue with ignored private DATA staging and the
  first emulator game frame. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-app-private-runtime.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 app-private RKG diagnostic and retail replay

- Added a debug-game-only bridge for the existing native RKG player fixture.
  It accepts exactly one bounded, magic-checked app-private file, sets the
  existing `_V2` diagnostic variables before SDL loads, emits no private path,
  and clears every variable when the file is absent or invalid.
- The ignored 2,016-byte staff input was staged after installation and verified
  by SHA-256. Its structural-only inspection reports course 8, 89.670 seconds,
  2,194 input bytes, and equal 5,615-frame streams. No input bytes, game data,
  save, or screenshot entered the APK or Git.
- The diagnostic selected Mario, Standard Kart M, automatic drift, and Luigi
  Circuit, then moved after the countdown. It diverged into the wall by guest
  time 10.881 and remained there at 34.236 on lap 1/3. No forced finish was
  enabled. This is a pass for the Android/private diagnostic bridge and a fail
  for natural player-fixture completion, matching the existing native warning.
- With the fixture disabled, a fresh PID rendered the retail Luigi Circuit
  staff Watch Replay for more than twelve wall-clock minutes at roughly
  9--13 FPS. Progress captures were byte-distinct, a finish-line crossing was
  observed, and no ImGui assertion, `SIGABRT`, or Java fatal exception appeared.
  Because Watch Replay has no player results/save contract, it does not satisfy
  the complete-race gate.
- The full game APK build, game release/source-only debug Kotlin compiles,
  `lintDebug`, and strict APK audit pass. The local 103,429,984-byte APK
  has SHA-256
  `c6b0eae50624f1e5466b679558a643e41cf8d721b3f3d5d4179303c3a038884e`;
  its stripped 83,533,016-byte `libmain.so` remains
  `71486d448c0765e916b95c3ca703d1276152357a912ad0d2fd49c673cc98b44a`.
  A2 remains open for a complete player race/results/save, real controller,
  and physical Android hardware. No package was hosted or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-debug-input-replay.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 keyboard-steer diagnostic

- Added an Android-only, debug-marker-gated hybrid for the existing RKG player
  fixture. Fixture acceleration remains deterministic while the Classic
  keyboard stick supplies steering; tricks are disabled and raw/float axes
  remain coherent. The ordinary RKG, keyboard/controller, release, and Apple
  paths are unchanged.
- The live Luigi Circuit player accepted `A`/`D` steering, including recovery
  from grass to track, but coarse diagnostic pulses did not hold a three-lap
  line. No forced finish was used and the run is rejected as completion.
- With keyboard steering disabled, exact GCN Mario Circuit staff metadata
  diverged at guest time 17.244. The exact SNES Mario Circuit 3 `01:38.880`
  staff stream and Mario / Standard Kart M / Manual configuration previously
  proven through the native macOS player path also diverged at 10.749. This
  falsifies natural Android RKG completion with the strongest available
  control.
- A guarded private all-cups save enabled the locked-course control. The
  original 2,867,200-byte save was restored byte-for-byte at SHA-256
  `07c4ff00b6eb686cff3b7c7bc365c0e453a99f1a1f8ad6ef9238679a73a71155`;
  the private RKG was disabled and marker removed. No private input, save, game
  data, or capture is packaged or committed.
- The full private debug APK builds at 103,430,368 bytes and SHA-256
  `6b4e750366661056e42470f995f833fd132c26643eb5f86761a371b85e710b3c`.
  Debug/release Kotlin compilation, lint, strict package audit, patch dry-run,
  diff check, and repository safety pass. Source verification accepts 395
  hunks plus WiiCompiled/SunPad/WheelWizard before the pre-existing ignored
  rr-pulsar checkout mismatch.
  Classification: **Pass for the bounded debug steering diagnostic; fail for
  complete player automation.** A2 remains open for a complete player race,
  results/save/relaunch, real controller, and physical Android hardware.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-keyboard-steer-diagnostic.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 SDL controller bridge

- Found that Aurora already opened Android SDL gamepads, but Mario Kart's
  Classic/KPAD HLE consumed only keyboard, RKG fixture, and the iOS mobile
  bridge. A connected Android controller therefore could not satisfy A2.
- Added a narrow public Aurora standard-gamepad snapshot and mapped it into the
  shared Classic contract. South/east/west/north map to A/B/X/Y, Start/Back to
  Plus/Minus, shoulders/triggers to L/R/ZL/ZR, D-pad directions directly, and
  the left stick through an 8,000-unit normalized/inverted deadzone.
- Explicit port assignments win. Player one may use a sole unassigned pad
  before A4's settings UI exists; multiple unassigned pads are never guessed.
  Existing KPAD history emits neutral state after secondary disconnect, and
  sanitized logs contain no controller identifiers.
- Added a host CTest and source-only Android marker for the shared mapping.
  Both API 36 / 4 KiB and API 35 / 16 KiB fixture lanes pass their complete
  lifecycle suites with the new marker.
- A fresh prepared private source graph compiled/linked, and a final reproduced
  tree matches all patched upstream files byte-for-byte. The audited local-only
  103,433,120-byte APK has SHA-256
  `7491b416ea3640b8d7a9cb8545fffe41dc625a4d378dd4d0d4abc8293ae22d01`;
  its stripped 83,536,152-byte `libmain.so` is
  `15a7c1dfecd40066b5f15dc950bb4d555d4375a09a21553ff9fbf9dd8f6c3c74`.
- Classification: **Pass for controller-path implementation, deterministic
  contract, patch reproduction, and private compile/link/package only.** No
  controller was attached, so live controller and physical-device acceptance
  remain open. No APK/AAB or private input was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-sdl-controller-bridge.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 SDL controller rumble

- Replaced Android's `WPADControlMotor` no-op with a narrow Aurora output API
  using the same explicit-port / sole-unassigned-player-one resolution rule as
  the accepted SDL input snapshot. Capability, connection, and SDL errors fail
  closed; Start uses configured low/high intensity and Stop is immediate.
- Added a pure host contract proving only WPAD command `1` enables rumble.
  Commands `0` and unknown values stop it. The Apple path is unchanged.
- Fresh preparation applies two new incremental patches and reproduces the
  three modified upstream files byte-for-byte. The complete private Original
  ARM64 graph compiled and linked in 8m19s; after centralizing input/output
  assignment in one resolver, the exact final source rebuilt and relinked in
  11s.
- The strict audit passes on the local-only 103,433,440-byte APK, SHA-256
  `3044e148e320236b0b71d4cf86ff8a5b158a896c75671f215a5da8c0faf23ad0`.
  Its stripped 83,536,472-byte `libmain.so` is
  `57856f61c5e1e162c0525b1d757eed46ccd27aaacf7a9bf287a20b78472954ad`.
  Host CTest, debug lint, release Kotlin compile, storage contract, repository
  safety, patch verification, and diff checks pass. The broad source verifier
  again stopped only after accepting 412 hunks and three pins because the
  ignored `rr-pulsar` checkout has the known unrelated pin mismatch.
- A temporary retail-KPAD replay hypothesis was tested and removed. The first
  mismatched Luigi Circuit run hit a wall at 14.346; an exact Baby Mario / PAL
  Nanobike / Manual N64 Mario Raceway run still diverged by 8.580. No forced
  finish was used. The marker, private RKG, source experiment, and emulator were
  removed or stopped, so this path must not be treated as completion evidence.
- Classification: **Pass for rumble implementation, deterministic command
  semantics, patch reproduction, private link, and audit only.** No controller
  was attached, so live rumble/input, complete player race/results/save, and
  physical Android acceptance remain open. No APK/AAB or private data was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-sdl-controller-rumble.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 controller lifecycle gate

- Added one Aurora lifecycle gate shared by Android's standard-gamepad input
  and rumble APIs. Surface loss or backgrounding makes snapshots neutral,
  rejects new rumble starts, and sends zero intensity to every active
  rumble-capable pad; stop remains legal while suspended.
- Serialized the bridge with controller add/remap/remove/shutdown so the
  Android UI thread cannot stop rumble through a controller pointer while the
  SDL event thread closes it. SDL background controller events remain enabled
  so releases during backgrounding are retained.
- The first ARM64 compile exposed a missing public Aurora input include. The
  first live launch then exposed a surface-before-Aurora initialization race
  that left the bridge suspended. Both were corrected before acceptance;
  initialization now derives state from the existing surface/background
  atomics.
- A corrected run logged the bridge active. One process later ended
  silently after its first resume without an Android fatal record. A fresh
  exact-final process retained PID `2293` through four HOME/surface recreation
  cycles with exactly four suspend/resume pairs and no Android fatal or
  `SIGABRT`; the
  earlier exit remains unexplained and is not counted as passing evidence.
- Host controller contract, clean patch dry-run, fresh exact source
  reproduction, private ARM64 compile/link, debug lint, release Kotlin compile,
  storage contract, package/privacy audit, repository safety, and diff checks
  pass. The broad verifier accepts 426 hunks and three pins before the known
  ignored `rr-pulsar` checkout/lock mismatch. The exact local-only APK is
  103,434,720 bytes at SHA-256
  `2c9c62b88277f34b27b481e254a25dd37936144d5c78a7db10eedb36c75e7145`;
  its 83,537,752-byte stripped `libmain.so` is
  `cf6b61932ef465c12135095ccfeb058c490fa2886f502d116c5dbeb9b87e0f24`.
  The lifecycle patch SHA-256 is
  `949aca693d660e966d0c3a8a6c10956e0f0aef0cc4488b8e10c6b96f01eee3a0`.
- Classification: **Pass for lifecycle-gated controller bridge implementation,
  exact reproduction, ARM64 link, and bounded emulator execution only.** No
  controller was attached, so real neutral input, motor stop, controller race,
  and physical Android acceptance remain open. No APK/AAB or private data was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-controller-lifecycle.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 complete trace-guided emulator race

- Added a debug-only Android marker that binds the existing content-free
  native state trace to a fixed app-private output before SDL starts. Marker
  absence clears the environment variable; release builds do not inspect it.
- A local feedback loop read only position, velocity, orientation, speed, and
  stage counters, then emitted ordinary Android `U`/`M`/`A`/`D` key events
  through the existing Classic/KPAD path. It never wrote guest state or forced
  checkpoints, laps, or finish. Supervised normal-input recoveries spent one
  collected mushroom and reversed/steered away from the final outer wall.
- Mario completed all three N64 Mario Raceway Time Trial laps. Native stage 4
  and a retail `05:17.517` result were visible; the summarizer accepts one
  19,032-sample race segment from race time 240 through 19,271 and finish.
- The game reported `Ghost data could not be saved.`, so no new ghost or race
  record save is claimed. A force-stop/cold relaunch retained the staged save
  byte-for-byte and reached title, but injected keys did not then advance the
  title despite app focus. Controller-after-relaunch remains open.
- One earlier restart in the same session ended silently without Java fatal,
  signal, tombstone, or OOM; a controlled retry completed the race. The exact
  pre-test save was restored by matching SHA-256, all app-private diagnostic
  files were removed, and the emulator was stopped.
- Debug/release Kotlin compilation, lint, full private ARM64 build, and strict
  package/privacy audit pass. The local-only APK is 103,434,784 bytes with
  SHA-256
  `94b7049a855cba90f9040f55fd56c894c989186832b3f63eb67ac29e48d4584a`.
  Classification: **Pass for the trace gate and a complete normal-input
  emulator race/results; open for post-race save, controller-after-relaunch,
  real controller/rumble, audible audio, and physical hardware.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-state-trace-player-race.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 virtual-controller hotplug and JNI fiber ownership

- Created a temporary ignored `/dev/uinput` Xbox-compatible controller on the
  API 36 ARM64 emulator. Android InputReader and SDL discovered it through the
  production controller path; no application-side controller state was
  injected.
- Pre-fix PID `4204` aborted under ART CheckJNI on the first south-button event.
  `SDL_GamepadConnected` forced Java-backed device polling from WiiCompiled's
  switched guest-fiber stack, invalidating ART's JNI transition-frame
  reference. Caching event-backed button/axis state fixed game-side reads, but
  a second hotplug on PID `4658` reproduced the same abort directly from
  `aurora::window::poll_events` during `AdvanceDueRetraces`.
- The exact correction makes standard KPAD reads pure cached snapshots, queues
  rumble for safe polling, exposes the original scheduler-fiber boundary, and
  permits Android SDL polling only on that stack. Aurora's opportunistic
  Android pump is disabled; other platforms retain existing behavior.
- Final PID `5007` survived connect, mapped button input, analog selection,
  disconnect, reconnect, HOME/background, HOT same-PID foreground, post-resume
  input, and final disconnect. The log recorded the expected core
  `0x00000800` / Classic `0x00000010` trigger and no CheckJNI, Java, or native
  fatal record.
- A normally paced same-process keyboard retry also advanced the earlier cold
  title through license selection to Main Menu, correcting that observation as
  a cadence false alarm. The prior `05:17.517` ghost-save message is consistent
  with the native slow-run recorder-overflow precedent, but no post-race save
  is claimed.
- Fresh preparation reproduces all seven changed upstream files exactly. Host
  controller contract, ARM64 build/link/package, lint, release Kotlin compile,
  storage contract, repository safety, SunPad snapshot, diff check, and strict
  APK/privacy audit pass. The source verifier accepts 444 hunks across 48
  patches before the known unrelated ignored `rr-pulsar` pin mismatch.
- The local-only 103,437,088-byte APK has SHA-256
  `44cbeed7bdca40541bdee71b944ffce17ee63fba10c05dca9777f0fe04f6a715`;
  its stripped 83,540,120-byte `libmain.so` is
  `67449ea532d61a17580f941b38ba74f52a2ea3cacf9d331a49bcf3143b69294a`.
  Classification: **Pass for emulator controller input/analog/hotplug,
  reconnect, and HOT lifecycle behavior; open for a natural controller-driven
  race/save and all physical-controller/hardware rows.** No APK/AAB or private
  data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-virtual-controller-hotplug.md`.

## 2026-09-03 — Android A2 controller cold-relaunch handoff

- The virtual InputReader/SDL controller navigated the entire Time Trial setup
  and entered live N64 Mario Raceway, closing controller-driven race entry on
  the emulator. A force-stop/relaunch with the controller still attached then
  exposed a real cold-input failure while rendering continued.
- Guest-fiber SDL polls were safely rejected but their work was lost. The
  corrected WiiCompiled boundary sets a pending request and services it on the
  original scheduler/JNI stack after a host-fiber return.
- Diagnostic timing exposed a second issue: one deferred poll could batch a
  down/up pair, leaving the level cache released before KPAD read it. Aurora
  now retains event-backed press edges for one game snapshot while preserving
  held levels.
- On exact uninstrumented PID `6595`, with the virtual controller attached
  before process startup, two deliberately short 250 ms taps advanced to
  Select License and then Main Menu. The process stayed live with no CheckJNI
  abort. One earlier clean-build launch independently hit the known
  intermittent missing Mii callback at `MiiManager::Init+0x134`; controlled
  retries remained live.
- Fresh preparation reproduced the final changed source byte-for-byte. The
  host gamepad contract, repository safety, overlay snapshot, diff check, full
  ARM64 build, and strict package/privacy audit pass. The local-only
  103,440,032-byte APK has SHA-256
  `2c11450996f33a35ba3aa85dcf16c1c467bf6fd4a0943edef966557639d7a6e7`.
  Classification: **Pass for emulator controller setup/race entry and cold
  title/license/menu navigation; open for a complete controller race/save and
  every physical-controller/device row.** No APK/AAB or private data was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-03/android/a2-controller-cold-relaunch.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A2 complete controller race and durable ghost

- Reused the exact local-only cold-input APK, SHA-256
  `2c11450996f33a35ba3aa85dcf16c1c467bf6fd4a0943edef966557639d7a6e7`,
  with validated ignored RMCP01 data and an isolated all-cups save in the API
  36 ARM64 emulator sandbox.
- Kept the temporary Xbox-compatible `/dev/uinput` device on Android's real
  InputReader/SDL/Aurora/Classic/KPAD path. A host feedback loop read only the
  opt-in content-free state trace and emitted ordinary controller analog and
  button events; it never wrote guest state or forced completion.
- Mario / Standard Kart M / Automatic completed all three N64 Mario Raceway
  laps at `04:28.063` (`01:23.445`, `01:19.112`, `01:45.506`). The trace moved
  from stage 2 to stage 4 at race timer tick `16308`, and retail results stated
  `Saved ghost data for KartPad!`.
- The save changed from pre-race SHA-256
  `40f5d5ae5ad93c39253559628a34359aa4627ebdc1b04605327cf2c59a5ff7e1`
  to `23c15850daace1587661aa07a99f08e450313963b469e683f13ae5dc0d6af005`.
  A force-stop/controller-attached cold launch retained the post-race hash,
  logged controller channel 0 connected on new PID `10983`, and displayed the
  `04:28.063` KartPad ghost in the course list and ghost chooser.
- The accepted run began fresh at a temporary 1280x720 AVD override after the
  original 2400x1080 surface proved too slow for a practical feedback run. The
  override, marker, live trace, controller, app, shared exports, and emulator
  were all cleaned up. An earlier `-wipe-data` mistake affected only the
  disposable AVD sandbox; independent private inputs and the isolated fixture
  were restaged, and no tracked, published, physical-device, or maintainer save
  was affected.
- Classification: **Pass for a complete controller-driven emulator race,
  results, ghost save, cold relaunch, and visible saved-result reload; open for
  physical controller/rumble, audible-output confirmation, performance, and
  physical Android hardware.** No APK/AAB or private data was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a2-controller-complete-race-save.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A2 physical-device intake gate

- Rechecked ADB after the complete emulator checkpoint; no physical device or
  emulator was attached, so no install, app-data mutation, or physical
  acceptance attempt was made.
- Added a read-only physical-device preflight that requires exactly one
  authorized target, rejects emulators, verifies API 28+, `arm64-v8a`, 4 KiB
  or 16 KiB pages, and 4 GiB free on `/data`, and records sanitized model,
  controller-source, installed-package, and Vulkan-inventory state.
- The preflight never prints the ADB serial, controller names, or Vulkan JSON.
  Its twelve-case fake-ADB contract covers pass, optional inventory absence,
  absent/unauthorized targets, enumeration failure, emulator, mid-probe
  disconnect, unsupported API/ABI/page size, low space, and missing-controller
  notice; every case also checks that the sentinel serial is absent.
- Classification: **Pass for deterministic, privacy-safe physical-device
  intake tooling; physical Android acceptance not run.** A2 remains open for
  the real-device controller race/save/relaunch, lifecycle, audible audio,
  tactile rumble, and performance rows. No APK/AAB or private data was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a2-physical-device-preflight.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A2 bounded runtime-signal evidence

- Added a streaming allowlist-only Android session-log summarizer. It emits a
  fixed content-free JSON schema for SDL audio initialization/non-silent/queue
  counters, channel-zero controller events, lifecycle counts, and explicit
  fatal-signature counts; it never copies arbitrary raw lines or source paths.
- Strict mode accepts only one capture or stdin and requires controller,
  non-silent submitted audio, a complete surface pause/resume plus gamepad-
  suspension cycle, and no fatal signature. It deliberately does not claim
  audible quality, tactile rumble, gameplay completion, save persistence, or
  performance.
- The self-test passes and rejects both malformed telemetry and a fatal signal.
  A two-file strict invocation exits 2 rather than merging unrelated sessions.
- Retrospective use on the exact controller-race console produced deterministic
  sanitized JSON: 32 kHz stereo, peak 3,988, 194,856,192 submitted bytes, zero
  post-start empty observations through 507,904 checks, 465 dropped blocks,
  controller events, and no fatal signature. Its combined matrix is correctly
  false because that one console lacks lifecycle events.
- Classification: **Pass for bounded Android A2 runtime-log evidence; A2 still
  open for the one-capture physical signal matrix and every hands-on physical
  row.** No APK/AAB, raw log, device identifier, controller name, save, or game
  data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a2-runtime-signal-sanitizer.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A2 UID-scoped capture path

- Added a two-phase physical-session wrapper. `start` runs the hardware
  preflight and stores only the device's own log timestamp in the ignored
  bootstrap directory; `summarize` reads KartPad-UID-scoped volatile logcat
  from that point and streams it into the strict signal sanitizer.
- Raw logcat never reaches a host file. The package UID and ADB serial are not
  emitted, and direct logcat errors are replaced with a generic message because
  ADB can echo its transport serial on disconnect.
- The fake-ADB contract passes start, strict summary, arbitrary private-line
  exclusion, and disconnect-error redaction. Bash syntax, repository safety,
  and diff checks pass. A disposable API 36 boot independently confirmed the
  real device-side `-T TIME` / `--uid=UIDS` options and exact UID/timestamp
  invocation, then shut down without launching KartPad. The host still has no
  physical ADB target, so the real capture command stopped before creating its
  marker.
- Classification: **Pass for the tested UID-scoped/raw-log-free capture path;
  physical execution not run.** A2 remains open for all real-device and
  hands-on rows. No APK/AAB, raw log, device identifier, package UID,
  controller name, save, or game data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a2-uid-scoped-capture.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 shared archive-path validation

- Kept A2 open because no physical Android target is attached, then selected
  the independent source-only portion of A3 authorized by the goal loop.
- Extracted the Apple Retro Rewind installer's ZIP member-path policy into a
  byte-oriented portable C++ validator. It rejects empty and absolute names,
  backslashes, embedded NULs, repeated/empty components, `.`/`..`, and colons
  while allowing one trailing directory slash.
- Wired the existing iOS/tvOS installer and every Apple product variant to the
  shared implementation immediately. The wrapper now validates minizip's
  explicit filename byte span before UTF-8 decoding, closing the prior
  C-string truncation gap for embedded NULs.
- The focused C++ contract passes. A targeted iOS Simulator SDK Objective-C++
  compile, pinned NDK API-28 ARM64 warning-as-error compile, fresh dual-product
  patch preparation, 29 builder/tvOS contracts, repository diff validation,
  and source wiring checks pass; one private
  payload test remains skipped because its optional input is not cached.
- A full dual iOS Simulator link stopped before compilation because the cached
  Dawn archive does not match the script's pinned SHA-256. The fail-closed
  check was preserved and the cache was not trusted or modified.
- Classification: **Pass for the portable path policy and immediate Apple
  consumer; full Apple link inconclusive due to an unrelated dependency-cache
  mismatch.** A2 remains the lowest incomplete goal, and A3 remains open for
  the Android owner, remaining shared installer rules, failure recovery, and
  complete emulator/physical offline acceptance. No APK/AAB or private input
  was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-shared-archive-path.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 shared archive scan

- Selected the next independent source-only A3 rule set while A2 remains open
  for unavailable physical Android hardware.
- Added a portable stateful archive scan for globally unsupported entry types,
  exact-root selection, maximum selected entries, and maximum expanded bytes.
  Checked-before-add accounting closes the Apple loop's theoretical unsigned
  total wrap; the first error latches so callers cannot resume a failed scan.
- Wired the Apple installer's preflight and extraction progress totals through
  the shared scan without changing the pinned root or public limits. iOS/tvOS
  and Original/Retro/dual product graphs all include the new implementation.
- Both direct archive contracts pass. Pinned NDK API-28 ARM64 and Apple SDK
  warning-as-error compiles, a fresh dual-product patch preparation, 29
  builder/tvOS contracts, repository safety, the SunPad snapshot, and diff
  checks pass. One optional private-payload test remains skipped because the
  input is not cached.
- The full Apple link remains unavailable at the previously recorded
  fail-closed local Dawn cache hash mismatch; no pin or cache was weakened.
- Classification: **Pass for the shared archive scan and immediate Apple
  consumer.** A2 remains open, and A3 remains incomplete for duplicate entries,
  content verification, Android ownership, fault recovery, and offline runtime
  acceptance. No APK/AAB or private input was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-shared-archive-scan.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 shared duplicate-entry rejection

- Extended the portable archive scan to reject a repeated selected component
  path before extraction. A file and directory spelling that differ only by a
  trailing slash intentionally collide; foreign-root duplicates remain ignored.
- Duplicate failure occurs before counters mutate and latches the scan. The
  existing Apple filesystem existence check remains defense in depth against a
  changed second pass or staging interference.
- Both direct archive contracts, pinned NDK API-28 ARM64 and Apple SDK
  warning-as-error compiles, builder/tvOS contracts, repository safety, the
  SunPad snapshot, and diff checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for shared pre-extraction duplicate rejection and its
  Apple consumer.** A2 and A3 remain open at their previously documented gates.
  No APK/AAB or private input was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-shared-archive-duplicates.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 install storage and recovery

- Added an Android-owned storage coordinator beneath app-private
  `filesDir/KartPad`. Production replacement uses same-volume atomic moves from
  generated staging to active storage while retaining the old complete install
  under a rollback name until activation succeeds.
- Added cold recovery before game-runtime SDL startup: stale imports are
  removed, exactly one rollback is restored when active storage is missing,
  and ambiguous state is left untouched. Tokens and normalized paths are
  bounded, and real-directory checks plus no-follow deletion reject symlink
  escapes.
- A pinned-JDK warning-as-error harness passes successful replacement and
  injected second-move failure/restore, plus stale, ambiguous, scope, token, and
  symlink cases. Public debug assemble, debug/release source compilation, lint,
  private game-runtime configuration compilation, package/privacy audit,
  repository safety, shell lint, and diff checks pass.
- The source-only APK is 33,675,275 bytes with SHA-256
  `ec5eefa73266e1dd15e76a9a76369093b3a4bb538022ffe5ea116d39c6bb5699`.
- Classification: **Pass for Android same-volume staging, activation,
  rollback, and startup recovery contracts.** A2 remains open, and A3 still
  lacks archive download/extraction/content validation and runtime acceptance.
  No APK/AAB or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-install-storage-recovery.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 profile-derived content validation

- Added a deterministic Java release-contract renderer and checked-in output
  for every Android-visible Retro Rewind profile pin. A builder test requires
  byte equality with the sole profile, preventing stale hand-copied constants.
- Added bounded strict-UTF-8 version reading and streaming SHA-256/size checks
  for the installed `Code.pul` and Riivolution XML. Unsafe relative requirements
  and symlinked directory/file nodes fail closed without returning absolute
  app-private paths.
- Joined validation to atomic activation. The test activates and revalidates a
  complete staged tree, then proves a missing-artifact tree remains staged and
  leaves the valid active install unchanged. Wrong/invalid/oversize version,
  missing, short, same-size tampered, unsafe, and symlinked cases also pass.
- The generated payload pin documents the exact already validated translated-
  build input; Android does not download that executable input at runtime.
- Pinned-JDK warning-as-error tests, 22 builder tests, public debug/release
  compilation, lint, private game-runtime configuration compilation, package/
  privacy audit, repository safety, shell lint, and diff checks pass. The
  source-only APK is 33,675,275 bytes at SHA-256
  `2c6ad2c220444e61ce36826f7b90116fa29be369ba43831d44af9dc670b15e5f`.
- Classification: **Pass for profile-derived release constants and installed-
  content validation gating activation.** A2 remains open; A3 still lacks
  download/free-space/ZIP extraction/worker lifecycle and runtime acceptance.
  No APK/AAB or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-content-validation.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 free-space preflight

- Added an overflow-safe pure Java storage evaluator and a thin Android probe
  that uses filesystem device IDs rather than path assumptions to distinguish
  shared app files/cache storage from separate stores.
- The policy retains a 256 MiB reserve. Shared storage must hold archive plus
  maximum expansion plus one reserve; separate stores independently require
  expansion plus reserve and archive plus reserve. The exact generated 6.12.5
  shared-store requirement is 4,327,477,355 bytes.
- Exact-boundary, one-byte-short, invalid, overflow, probe-failure, and
  production-drift tests pass with Java warnings treated as errors. Existing
  content/storage matrices, 30 builder/tvOS tests, public assemble and release
  compilation, lint, repository safety, and the strict APK audit also pass.
- The source-only APK is 33,675,275 bytes with SHA-256
  `700b899ed7ee22ecb87837542100427dd99ed5829b8b8d0615a50c38a3df7994`.
- Classification: **Pass for free-space accounting and the Android capacity
  probe.** No downloader/worker invokes it yet, and A2/A3 runtime acceptance
  remains open. No APK/AAB or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-space-preflight.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 pinned archive download

- Added a pinned HTTPS archive owner with at most five secure redirects,
  bounded timeouts, identity encoding, declared/exact byte checks, streamed
  SHA-256, cancellation, verified-cache reuse, and same-directory atomic
  publication. Unverified partial bytes are never promoted.
- Added INTERNET as Android's sole manifest permission and changed the package
  audit to require that exact allowlist. Any additional permission fails.
- The first lint run rejected the host-Java `HexFormat` API because it requires
  Android API 34. The replacement uses API-28-safe digest decoding/comparison;
  the complete compile/lint rerun passes.
- Warning-as-error transfer tests cover exact content, existing revalidation,
  short/long streams, wrong hash, cancellation, injected network loss, and a
  symlink. Earlier A3 matrices, 30 builder/tvOS tests, public assemble/release
  compilation, private source configuration, package audit, shell/diff checks,
  and repository safety pass.
- The source-only APK is 33,675,275 bytes with SHA-256
  `88129b305de90f0588cbd93978ede89fc061010b2420f3beb344522607052b65`.
- Classification: **Pass for pinned acquisition and verified atomic cache
  publication contracts.** No worker/UI invokes it, the production archive was
  not downloaded, and ZIP extraction/process-death/runtime acceptance remain
  open. No APK/AAB or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-archive-download.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 bounded extraction and activation pipeline

- Locked the official 772,757-byte minizip-ng 4.0.8 commit archive at SHA-256
  `e0fa42896ad244261f100fd06fae7c64f6054ce02d143f4d0f55df5fced9f63d`
  and added fail-closed bootstrap/CMake integration for both Android products.
- Added a two-pass shared-policy extractor with strict UTF-8, no-follow
  directory-relative output, exclusive files, exact byte/CRC enforcement,
  cancellation, and progress. The Java pipeline revalidates the archive, then
  joins extraction to content validation and atomic activation; failed staging
  is removed without touching active content and startup recovery covers death.
- Host extraction and Java pipeline fault matrices pass. Coverage includes
  traversal, duplicates/aliases, links, encryption, slash data, invalid UTF-8,
  missing root, limits, cancellation, CRC corruption, foreign entries, invalid
  content/archive, and a pre-existing destination symlink.
- Public build/release compile/API-28 lint, full private native linkage, strict
  package/privacy/dependency/license audit, existing A3 tests, scoped shared
  archive CTests, SunPad snapshot, 30 builder/tvOS tests, safety, shell, and diff
  checks pass. An initial unscoped CTest command only found the two deliberately
  built archive binaries; its scoped rerun passed both.
- Wiped API 36 4 KiB and API 35 16 KiB ARM64 AVDs both passed the new JNI
  extraction marker plus the complete existing A1/A2 fixture suite, then shut
  down cleanly. No ADB target remains.
- The source-only APK is 33,834,881 bytes with SHA-256
  `dd891d78ffcd16fed258631ce9e92db95e343e2775e838ae97d3fe8d112ca3e2`.
- Classification: **Pass for bounded extraction and validation-gated atomic
  activation contracts, including Android JNI execution.** Production-size
  download, durable worker/process-death behavior, Retro Rewind runtime, and
  physical acceptance remain open. No artifact or private data was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-archive-extraction.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 durable foreground install worker

- Locked AndroidX WorkManager 2.11.1 and added one unique connected-network
  foreground job that orders recovery, exact space preflight, pinned download,
  bounded extraction, content validation, atomic activation, and cache cleanup.
- Work phase and byte progress are persisted and mirrored in the visible
  data-sync notification. Duplicate enqueue uses `KEEP`; transport faults
  retry, integrity/storage/install faults fail closed, and a stable facade
  exposes cancellation for the future A4 setup UI.
- Wiped 4 KiB and 16 KiB AVDs each started one fixture after two enqueue calls
  and completed it. A separate wiped API 36 run force-stopped the app during
  active work, confirmed the process was absent, then observed the same work
  UUID restart at attempt 1 and complete after an ordinary activity relaunch.
- All seven underlying A3 contract runners, public build/release compilation,
  lint, private game-source compilation, strict package/privacy audit, the
  22-test builder suite, SunPad snapshot, safety, shell, and diff checks pass.
  The source verifier reaches the known unrelated ignored `rr-pulsar`
  checkout/lock mismatch.
- The source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes with SHA-256
  `5ee1edf08ceb2173f9fc32824872c1489d80e1fddf6dd8f41738a73b5cfa19a7`.
- Classification: **Pass for unique foreground orchestration, progress,
  cancellation/retry policy, duplicate suppression, and injected app-process
  death recovery on the emulator.** Partial HTTP resume, the production
  download/install and interruption matrix, Retro Rewind gameplay/mode
  switching, and physical hardware remain open. No APK/AAB, production archive,
  or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-install-worker.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 resumable archive download

- Replaced random disposable download files with one version-scoped
  app-private partial. Resume rehashes the exact existing prefix, requests the
  remaining range, appends only after an exact `206 Content-Range`, and safely
  truncates when a conforming server ignores Range and returns `200`.
- Oversized, complete-corrupt, symlinked, or non-regular partial state resets
  without following links. Network loss/cancellation preserves progress;
  permanent protocol/integrity faults discard it. Atomic publication still
  requires the complete profile size and SHA-256.
- Host tests cover exact request headers, valid/malformed/overflowing ranges,
  safe full restart, a second resume after injected network loss, offset
  mismatch, progress, corrupt/oversized reset, and an untouched symlink target.
- Wiped 4 KiB and 16 KiB AVDs execute a seven-byte prefix append through the
  Android API. The durable API 36 fault run additionally persisted seven bytes,
  killed the app process, and observed the same UUID restart at attempt 1 from
  byte 7 and finish the fully verified fixture.
- A body-free HTTPS `HEAD` request to the profile URL returned 200, the exact
  pinned 1,859,041,899-byte length, ZIP content type, and
  `Accept-Ranges: bytes`. No production archive bytes were downloaded, and a
  real ranged GET remains unproven.
- All A3 contract runners, public/private source configurations, release
  compilation, lint, package/privacy audit, builder suite, SunPad snapshot,
  safety, shell, and diff checks pass. The source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes
  at SHA-256
  `f5b001c206abb5dd05bc0c58f8f6e6f2b5c684361ccaaa0f079f259e9f173364`.
- Classification: **Pass for bounded resumable acquisition and verified
  nonzero-prefix recovery after real app-process death on the emulator.** The
  official production server/1.86 GB transfer, remaining production faults,
  gameplay/mode switching, and physical acceptance remain open. No APK/AAB,
  archive, or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-resumable-download.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 install-worker activity recreation

- Added a debug-source-only lightweight installer activity, absent from
  release and protected by Android's privileged `DUMP` permission for ADB
  launch. It runs outside SDL, requests recreation while work is active, and
  re-enqueues after recreation to exercise unique `KEEP` behavior.
- The final wiped API 36 run kept PID 4580, observed destruction/recreation,
  and completed the original worker UUID after exactly one attempt-0 start.
  The same harness first reconfirmed process-death resume from a six-byte
  persisted prefix at attempt 1.
- An initial experiment recreated `SDLActivity` during native window startup;
  its expected game-window teardown caused process restart, so that code was
  removed and is not claimed as installer activity evidence.
- Public debug build, release compilation, API-28 lint, private game-source
  compilation, package/privacy audit, relevant A3 tests, builder suite, SunPad
  snapshot, safety, shell, and diff checks pass. The source-only APK is
  33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `e1a06115225c52e9749349a14d6fa22fd9688dd84b084604ddc679fe31a52b84`.
- Classification: **Pass for same-process installer activity recreation
  without duplicate foreground work.** Production UI observation/cancellation,
  official archive/fault execution, gameplay/mode switching, and physical
  hardware remain open. No artifact or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-worker-activity-recreation.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 install-worker cancellation

- Added a cancellation mode to the shell-protected debug installer activity.
  It starts the actual resumable worker fixture, calls the production
  unique-work cancellation facade during append, and observes the request by
  UUID until WorkManager reaches a terminal state.
- The final wiped API 36 run cancelled one attempt-0 worker after seven bytes,
  observed terminal `CANCELLED`, retained the seven-byte partial, and found no
  worker completion or application fatal. The same run reconfirmed nonzero
  process-death resume and same-PID activity recreation.
- Debug/release compilation, API-28 lint, private game-source compilation,
  package/privacy audit, relevant A3 and builder tests, SunPad snapshot,
  repository safety, shell syntax/lint, and diff checks pass. The source-only
  APK is 33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `b18b26c878a94b071859d389730f9e37ed7526f40739552a814e245fea7f3d6b`.
- Classification: **Pass for explicit worker cancellation, partial retention,
  and no false success on the emulator.** The production UI, official archive
  cancellation, remaining production faults/gameplay, and physical hardware
  remain open. No artifact or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-worker-cancellation.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 production installer UI

- Added a release-owned, non-exported Retro Rewind installer/status activity.
  It observes the persisted unique WorkManager chain, shows waiting and
  determinate phase/byte progress, exposes production Cancel/Retry actions, and
  is the immutable explicit destination for foreground-notification taps.
- A prior successful work record is not enough to display ready: installed
  content is rehashed against the pinned version/artifact contract on a private
  executor. The debug fixture explicitly says that it installed no game data.
- On a wiped API 36 AVD, UUID
  `cf536fba-365b-446d-ba12-51f1884156e9` reached the visible running state. The
  real Cancel control was activated by focus navigation, terminal `CANCELLED`
  appeared with Retry, no completion marker was accepted, and an app force-
  stop/reopen restored the cancelled state.
- Android 13+ starts now require notification permission and Android 12+
  requests immediate foreground display. The wiped run proved an active
  actionable KartPad notification and its explicit installer-activity target.
- A3 host contracts, the new UI harness, debug/release compile, API-28 lint,
  package/privacy audit, builder tests, SunPad snapshot, repository safety,
  shell, and diff checks pass. The exact source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes at
  SHA-256
  `2e0e28fab71ea96e4d17e46fea5b7699b690284736010ff441f795be509d8079`.
- Classification: **Pass for production UI ownership, visible observation and
  cancellation, notification return, and validation before ready.** Normal
  startup still lacks its dual-mode chooser route; production archive/fault,
  gameplay, and physical acceptance remain open. No artifact or private data
  was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-installer-ui.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind version freshness

- Added the profile's official version-manifest URL to Android's generated
  release contract and placed a fail-closed freshness check after recovery but
  before capacity preflight/archive acquisition.
- The HTTPS client permits only secure bounded redirects, identity transfer,
  15-second timeouts, cancellation, strict UTF-8, and at most 512 KiB. Version
  comparison handles two to four arbitrary-length numeric components without
  overflow; any malformed nonempty line invalidates the feed.
- Direct faults cover current/newer/older and padded versions, huge components,
  malformed/oversized/encoded bodies, insecure/looping redirects, HTTP/network
  failure, and cancellation. A newer valid feed returns a specific KartPad-
  update-required result before any archive state can change.
- The host JVM and wiped API 36 AVD independently reached the official service
  and reported `6.12.5`, equal to the compiled profile. The wiped run also
  reconfirmed PR #55 notification/UI cancellation and persistence with bounded
  worker UUID `0b41fe6c-0508-4315-a41f-85e777ce577d`. No archive was requested.
- Eight A3 source contracts, public/private compile configurations, API-28
  lint, APK audit, builder tests, SunPad snapshot, repository safety, shell,
  and diff checks pass. Source verification reaches only the unchanged ignored
  `rr-pulsar` checkout mismatch after all 446 hunks and other pins pass. The
  source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `391f183e6fd4aebb540ad561c6fef436a4bf9cfe1857f205e7480e3e911389e2`.
- Classification: **Pass for generated version authority, bounded official-
  feed handling, Android TLS execution, and stale-profile blocking before
  acquisition.** The normal chooser/installed fallback, archive/install fault
  execution, gameplay/mode switching, and physical hardware remain open. No
  artifact or private data was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-version-freshness.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 device install fault execution

- Added a debug-only Android fixture that loads the APK's real JNI extraction
  library and drives the production archive verifier, extractor, content
  validator, same-volume activation, and startup recovery against bounded
  synthetic packs in app-private storage.
- The device sequence installs and validates an initial pack, rejects an
  appended corrupt archive before extraction, and confirms the active install
  is unchanged. A token-scoped rollback collision then injects activation
  failure; the old valid install remains and only failed staging is removed.
  A final valid replacement activates, then is moved into the exact
  single-rollback/no-active-install crash window alongside stale staging.
  Startup recovery restores it and removes stale staging with no transient
  entries.
- The first compile rejected two checked file-metadata calls inside the
  non-throwing verifier lambda. Moving those values outside the lambda fixed
  the error. Review then moved the fixture trigger out of production
  `KartPadActivity` and into the debug-only fixture activity so the release
  source graph and artifact remain free of the test implementation.
- Final wiped API 36 / 4 KiB and API 35 / 16 KiB ARM64 AVD runs both observed
  `A3 device install faults passed existing=preserved replacement=valid
  recovery=restored` and
  all surrounding memory/fiber/controller/worker/Vulkan/lifecycle markers.
  Both emulators shut down; no ADB target remains.
- All eight A3 source runners, release compile, API-28 lint, debug assemble,
  strict APK/privacy audit, SunPad snapshot, repository safety, shell, and diff
  checks pass. Source verification validates 446 patch hunks and every other
  pin before the unchanged ignored `rr-pulsar` checkout mismatch; it was not
  mutated. The exact source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `f9f9a83182b9de5ff76f6751355677c3f97c90eb6246b7bdffb87c95c7b95b65`.
- Classification: **Pass for the existing-valid-install fault and atomic
  replacement through Android's real app-private/JNI path on both page-size
  lanes.** The official archive, production-size/full-disk execution, normal
  mode routing/gameplay, and physical hardware remain open. No production
  archive, private data, APK, or AAB was downloaded or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-device-install-faults.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 real low-space preflight

- Added a debug-only route to run the production `RetroRewindSpaceProbe`
  against real Android `filesDir`/`cacheDir`, plus a wiped-AVD harness whose
  byte requirement comes from the sole Retro Rewind profile.
- The harness refuses an existing device, caps guest filling at 2 GiB, requires
  8 GiB of host reserve, and deletes only its explicit disposable filler. The
  first ShellCheck pass rejected an ambiguous compound assertion; an explicit
  conditional fixed it before any low-space run began.
- A wiped API 36 / 4 KiB ARM64 AVD used a controlled 1,121 MiB filler. The
  production probe observed 4,186,030,080 bytes available against the exact
  4,327,477,355-byte same-store requirement and returned
  `INSUFFICIENT_SHARED_STORE`. The harness confirmed zero archive bytes/cache
  state, deleted the filler, and stopped the emulator.
- Android's image has no usable `fstrim`; the dedicated sparse AVD image keeps
  allocated blocks for reuse. Host free space remains 44 GiB. Debug assemble,
  strict APK/privacy audit, eight A3 source runners, release compile/API-28
  lint, SunPad snapshot, repository safety, shell lint/syntax, and diff checks
  pass. Source verification validates 446 hunks and every other pin before the
  unchanged ignored `rr-pulsar` mismatch; it was not mutated. The exact
  source-only APK is 33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `dda33041fd82e4db874562313dad5bdd583d9d164199d87dad55acc287779e7d`.
- Classification: **Pass for real Android same-store preflight refusal under a
  controlled byte deficit before archive acquisition.** Mid-transfer or
  mid-extraction `ENOSPC`, the official production-size install, gameplay, and
  physical hardware remain open. No production archive, private data, APK, or
  AAB was downloaded or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-device-low-space.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 mid-extraction ENOSPC

- Added a debug-only two-phase fixture that installs a valid existing pack,
  then runs a separately verified synthetic replacement through the production
  JNI extraction/validation/activation pipeline after the backing filesystem
  is deliberately constrained.
- The guarded harness creates an exact temporary API 36 AVD, mounts a 512 MiB
  ext4 loop image at app-private `KartPad`, derives ownership/SELinux context
  from the installed package, and proves app access. The replacement archive
  is created first, and an 8 GiB host reserve remains mandatory.
- A 368,544 KiB filler left insufficient expansion capacity. JNI wrote
  117,440,519 bytes of a validated 402,653,184-byte payload before
  `IO_FAILURE`; the pipeline reported extraction failure, deleted partial
  staging, and the prior installed pack still passed exact validation.
- An attempted smaller emulator data partition was ignored by the system image
  and the unchanged 6 GiB partition was observed before stopping it; no 5 GiB
  fill was attempted. The bounded loop mount replaced that disproportionate
  route. One manual cleanup used an unset SDK variable, then deleted the exact
  temporary AVD with the resolved pinned path before the automated run.
- Cleanup unmounted/deleted the loop image, stopped the emulator, deleted the
  temporary AVD and host fixtures, and left no ADB target. Host free space
  returned to 46 GiB. Debug assemble/package audit pass; the exact source-only
  APK is 33,843,921 bytes at SHA-256
  `120eb052dbe10d3967ff8a58ea3032526d5d1d2982e580ccdf92092d30b49e1a`.
- All eight A3 source contracts, source-only release compile/API-28 lint,
  private game-runtime debug Kotlin/Java compile, SunPad snapshot, repository
  safety, shell, and diff checks pass. Source verification validates 446 hunks
  and every other pin before the unchanged ignored `rr-pulsar` mismatch; it
  was not mutated.
- Classification: **Pass for real Android mid-extraction ENOSPC with measured
  JNI progress, partial-staging cleanup, and preservation of a previous valid
  install.** Production-size archive/peak-space, gameplay/mode switching, and
  physical hardware remain open. No production archive, private data, APK, or
  AAB was downloaded or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-device-enospc.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 official production install

- Drove the release-owned installer on a wiped API 36 ARM64 AVD through the
  real official Retro Rewind 6.12.5 transfer. All 1,859,041,899 bytes arrived
  and matched the profile-pinned SHA-256.
- The first run reached native extraction and failed because the cold
  WorkManager process had not loaded `libmain.so`. The extractor now owns a
  lazy JNI load; the non-SDL device pipeline fixture no longer preloads it and
  passes from a cold process.
- Retry then correctly exposed that preflight charged a verified cached
  archive twice. The pure capacity evaluator now accepts bounded reusable
  bytes; Android credits only a verified final archive or a safe regular
  partial that the downloader can reuse/replace, while retaining the 2.2 GB
  expansion ceiling and 256 MiB reserve.
- The patched APK reused the verified cache, completed native extraction and
  atomic activation, removed the archive, and reported 2,110,038,016 installed
  bytes. The pinned `Code.pul` and XML size/hash checks pass.
- Force-stop plus airplane mode still produced `Retro Rewind is ready` after a
  cold validation. Focused host tests, debug build, and strict APK audit pass;
  the current source-only APK SHA-256 is
  `fca7cf95024310b40471b2b750e6571b1fb94fb31faa03abfd8af3bf9424358d`.
- Classification: **Pass for official production-size installation and
  offline pack revalidation on the ARM64 emulator.** Gameplay/mode switching,
  physical acceptance, and publishing remain open. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-production-install.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 dual-runtime offline boot

- Regenerated the full private dual translation graph and drove it through the
  real Android build. The first builds exposed three integration defects:
  Gradle tried to build standalone products, Android `KartPadDual` inherited a
  standalone-base dependency through PCH reuse, and generated Retro blob
  assembly used Windows-only section syntax.
- Android now selects exactly `WiiCompiled` or `KartPadDual` from the prepared
  graph, builds the dual product as the sole `libmain.so` with its own PCH, and
  normalizes copied Retro `.S` inputs to an ELF read-only data section without
  mutating private generated sources.
- A fresh patch preparation and complete dual build pass. The strict audit
  accepts the 119,088,910-byte APK at SHA-256
  `d1490d5b6d9ed38012a5793e609c6c05dd4d26c1704abad9d6e423cac43867c9`
  and finds only SDL, libc++, and `libmain.so` native libraries with no private
  data or local-path leakage.
- The preserved 6 GiB emulator data filesystem had only about 2.3 GiB free, so
  the roughly 1.9 GiB validated pack and 2.5 GiB disc could not coexist. After
  a recoverable overlay backup, the disposable AVD was expanded/wiped to a
  10 GiB filesystem and retained about 3.8 GiB free after staging.
- With airplane mode enabled, explicit validated `retro_rewind` selection
  activated the Retro profile, mounted 4,878 overlays, emitted Vulkan/audio
  evidence, and reached the branded title and main menu without base fallback.
  A format-valid empty diagnostic save was used only after both base and Retro
  controls reproduced the wiped-NAND system-memory warning.
- Retro Rewind created a KartPad license. Its real save hash remained exactly
  `9c451f517267b800a7100bcf3f7445917ddca2361dc7deb1d184f76086600604`
  across force-stop/airplane-mode cold relaunch, which again reached the Retro
  main menu. Source contracts, generated link test, shell syntax, package
  audit, and diff checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for Android dual linking and an explicit validated
  Retro Rewind 6.12.5 offline title/menu boot with save-preserving cold
  relaunch.** A race, production chooser, general fresh-NAND creation, touch
  parity, physical hardware, and release acceptance remain open. No private
  input, APK, or AAB was committed or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-dual-runtime-offline-boot.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro replay isolation

- Reused the validated offline 6.12.5 pack on the API 36 ARM64 emulator and
  manually matched the official SNES Donut Plains 1 expert's Mario,
  Sneakster, and Manual metadata.
- Added a temporary debug launch switch that disabled the existing base-course
  RKG metadata writes. The live-controller fixture retained its expected
  238-frame synchronization offset but again entered the barrier/off-road
  failure around `00:19.380`; the switch was removed after it falsified the
  metadata-overwrite hypothesis.
- Renamed the diagnostic input out of its recognized path, cold-started Retro
  Rewind, and selected its native Replay path for the same official card. It
  followed the expanded course, crossed into lap 2, and reached the three-lap
  finish/results presentation without an Android fatal record. The result was
  `00:57.691`, not the card's `01:34.086`, so no timing-fidelity claim is made.
- The KartPad save changed from the prior accepted cold-relaunch SHA-256
  `9c451f517267b800a7100bcf3f7445917ddca2361dc7deb1d184f76086600604`
  to `c5496e08dceab593a787b1363b2a4ce756313cebd768ab2d0d814c99db931383`
  after results. After diagnostic cleanup and installation of the clean rebuilt
  APK, a force-stop/cold launch returned to the branded Retro title and retained
  that exact changed hash.
- Classification: **Partial pass for native Retro Rewind expanded-course replay
  and results on the Android emulator; fail for using the live-controller RKG
  fixture as A3 race proof.** The metadata override is ruled out. The remaining
  boundary is most likely Retro Rewind transmission/RKG input semantics, but a
  controller-driven race, trustworthy timing, its save/relaunch, mode
  switching, physical hardware, and release acceptance remain open. No APK,
  AAB, or private input was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-retro-replay-isolation.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro fixture simulator controls

- Selected the official `ExpertsRT/10_150.rkg` card on the API 36 ARM64
  emulator: Koopa Troopa, Cheep Charger, Manual, Classic Controller, course ID
  16, 6,578 frames, and `01:45.736`. Because Cheep Charger is a kart, the
  selected Outside transmission is a no-op matching the RKG default.
- With metadata forcing disabled, the stage-1 fixture initially followed the
  course but diverged near the fence around 21 seconds and was stationary by
  about 35 seconds. This falsifies the remaining transmission explanation.
- An experimental native build delayed input consumption until RaceManager
  stage 2. Its transcript confirmed the changed boundary, but the same kart
  diverged into water at about `00:07.383`, earlier than the control. The
  one-line change was reverted; the observed 238-row trace offset represents
  countdown samples rather than proven fixture-frame lead.
- A subsequent oracle setup accidentally used the wrong Android debug-extra
  name and launched the base profile. Its save-country recovery attempt left
  the synthetic emulator save unusable; preserved copies and the pre-existing
  Retro save were not deleted. This invalidates the current emulator save as a
  continuation precondition but does not alter earlier committed evidence.
- Restored the source behavior, rebuilt the dual ARM64 APK, and passed the
  strict package/privacy audit at SHA-256
  `44b485b9e0a6c2dcc0292777d32e81116981462881e14aa3ead739b5f1e386b1`.
  That clean local APK was installed and the RKG/state-trace diagnostics were
  removed; it was not launched against the now-invalid save.
- Classification: **Fail for both proposed fixture causes; useful narrowing.**
  Metadata forcing, transmission choice, and the stage-2 start theory are now
  ruled out. A real controller race and a clean simulator save precondition
  remain open. No APK, AAB, RKG, disc, save, or pack was published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro save-precondition recovery

- Instrumented the API 36 ARM64 emulator after the diagnostic save-country
  setup. With the Retro `rksys.dat` absent, translated Mii initialization failed
  before the runtime received a `NANDCreate` call. A format-valid empty save
  that boots Original mode also failed in Retro after the branded title.
- Isolated the adjacent Retro state. Removing the leaderboard and regenerating
  `RRGameSettings.pul` did not fix the empty-save launch. The old and fresh
  settings differed only at `MiscParams.lastSelectedCup` (`0x42` versus
  `0xffffffff`), and both failed against the empty save.
- Restoring the preserved original Retro save, settings, and leaderboard as a
  coherent trio remained alive beyond 50 seconds and reached the branded
  title. This separates the damaged diagnostic precondition from the earlier
  live-player replay divergence.
- Removed the temporary NAND logging, rebuilt the clean dual ARM64 APK, passed
  the strict package/privacy audit at SHA-256
  `340c33f207a651cb2be0f01cc7663dca64a946adfd7e2f033ae4882f5e4b807e`,
  installed it locally, and cold-launched the restored Retro state to the
  title. No APK, AAB, save, disc, RKG, or pack was published.
- Classification: **Pass for simulator-state recovery and root-boundary
  isolation; general fresh Retro save creation remains open.**

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 save-precondition correction

- Revalidated the prior save-precondition diagnosis rather than building on a
  single process exit. Temporary content-free telemetry around Mii-library
  allocations showed heap `0x9011299c`, vtable `0x802a2ff8`, a 417,568-byte
  first allocation, and two 6,400-byte allocations without corruption.
- With the Retro redirect absent, the runtime populated it from the valid empty
  base save and reached the branded title. After removing the telemetry and
  rebuilding the exact clean APK at the prior audited SHA-256, the same empty
  save remained alive beyond 55 seconds. Removing only the leaderboard also
  stayed alive.
- Six subsequent identical clean force-stop/cold-launch cycles all remained
  alive after 22 seconds. The preserved original Retro save and leaderboard
  were restored afterward and the title again stayed live.
- Classification: **Correction.** The earlier exits are not reproducible and
  do not prove a missing-save, settings, leaderboard, or Mii-manager defect.
  Full first-run license creation remains open. No private file or diagnostic
  APK was committed or published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 RFL alarm context isolation

- Explicit Original to Retro Rewind to Original switching reproduced the
  intermittent Mii initialization exit once across eight observed pre-fix
  Original launches: six base-only controls and two within the switch sequence.
  The private crash record showed r30 changed from the
  expected guest heap pointer to a callback result before the second allocation.
- Root cause was RFL alarm polling executing guest callbacks against the live
  translated caller register file. The override now uses a private interrupt
  context and suppresses guest scheduler switching only while pumping the
  bounded alarm queue.
- Ten of ten patched Original cold launches remained alive after 28 seconds. A
  subsequent visible-emulator Original/Retro/Original sequence passed beyond
  35/35/40 seconds, retained both exact save hashes, and produced no new
  missing-target record.
- Fresh Android preparation reproduced the source, the affected Apple arm64
  runtime object compiled, and the strict package/privacy audit passed for the
  local-only APK at SHA-256
  `2ba4b4acf7a395c3d810ff81c0327ad15f9bfbbcbcd76da026ec37444ff7b7d2`.
- Classification: **Pass for the diagnosed callback corruption and bounded
  emulator mode switch.** Controller-driven Retro race/save, trustworthy
  timing, production mode selection, physical controller/audio/rumble,
  physical hardware, and release acceptance remain open. No private input or
  binary was committed or published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 production mode chooser

- Replaced normal reliance on the debug runtime-profile extra with a
  production launcher that validates Retro Rewind before SDL starts and shows
  side-by-side Original and Retro choices. The first vertical render put Retro
  below the fold and was rejected; the compact layout shows both choices at
  the emulator's landscape phone density.
- Selecting the preserved valid install through the visible chooser reached
  the branded Retro title beyond 30 seconds. A cold chooser launch then
  selected Original and reached its title beyond 30 seconds. The production
  profile logs were distinct, both save hashes stayed exact, and no new
  missing-target record appeared.
- A landscape flip recreated the chooser with both controls restored. A
  debug-only missing-install control showed the download state and routed to
  the production installer without moving or deleting the installed pack.
- Made the SDL activity private in the release manifest while retaining
  `DUMP`-protected shell access in debug builds. Android lint also exposed and
  fixed an existing API-28-incompatible `Stream.toList()` call in a debug
  install fixture.
- Full dual-profile build, lint, release-manifest merge, content/storage/
  pipeline/worker contracts, and strict package/privacy audit pass for the
  local-only APK at SHA-256
  `7088f683c9cc765c77a12203646af6d9ecdb13f1eb77f559b4bfdbc75e1caf94`.
- Classification: **Pass for the production chooser and bounded emulator mode
  selection.** Controller-driven Retro race/save, trustworthy timing, physical
  controller/audio/rumble, hardware, and release acceptance remain open. No
  private input or binary was committed or published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind controller race/save

- Registered an ignored Xbox-compatible virtual controller through Android's
  normal `uinput`/InputReader path, selected the production Retro Rewind
  profile, and used controller input for title/license/menu navigation and all
  live race acceleration/steering.
- Rejected blind long steering intervals after they repeatedly left a narrow
  lava course. Selected GCN Baby Park and replaced them with a content-free
  state-trace feedback loop that emitted only ordinary analog controller
  events. It completed the live Time Trial at finish stage 4; results reported
  `17:13.562`, best lap `00:19.742`, and ghost creation.
- The controller's explicit one-hour registration expired mid-race. The
  runtime logged channel-zero disconnect/reconnect and completed the same race
  after reattachment, with no fatal signature.
- Advancing results changed the isolated Retro save from SHA-256 `3c4aeacd...`
  to `7279ad4d...`. A force-stop and production-chooser cold relaunch as a new
  process retained the exact post-results hash, reconnected the controller,
  reached the branded title, and accepted navigation back to Baby Park.
- Classification: **Pass for controller-driven Retro emulator gameplay,
  race/results, save mutation, and byte-stable controller-attached cold
  relaunch.** The deliberately slow record did not replace the faster bundled
  selectable ghost, so visible new-record reload, trustworthy timing, physical
  controller/audio/rumble, physical hardware, and release acceptance remain
  open. No APK, AAB, private input, save, trace, console, or screenshot was
  published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind cold record inspection

- Repeated the cold-relaunch test visibly in the API 36 ARM64 emulator with
  the Android-recognized virtual Xbox controller attached. A direct launch of
  the private SDL activity first selected `base` by design and was rejected as
  a test-harness error; the corrected production launcher showed both choices,
  selected validated Retro Rewind, and reached its branded title as new PID
  7904.
- Controller navigation returned to the course ghost screen after the true
  production-path cold launch. It still showed only `1/1`, with a faster
  packaged Rewind ghost rather than the completed `17:13.562` run.
- Pulled the exact cold-loaded save read-only. It remained 2,867,200 bytes at
  SHA-256 `7279ad4d...`, had valid `RKSD0006` and `RKPD` structures, and its
  stored core CRC-32 exactly matched a fresh calculation. The only initialized
  license had personal-ghost bitfield `0x00000000` and no nonzero primary Time
  Trial leaderboard timer.
- Classification: **Correction and narrowed pass.** The prior race/results,
  save mutation, and byte-stable cold persistence remain valid, but the slow
  result did not create a retained personal record/ghost. A faster
  controller-driven record/save/reload proof remains open. The emulator was
  left running visibly in Retro Rewind; no private save or binary was
  published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind save-diff and fast-fixture rejection

- Recovered the retained ignored pre-race save directly from the emulator and
  verified its full SHA-256 is the recorded `3c4aeacd...`. It differs from the
  cold-loaded `7279ad4d...` post-race save by only 12 bytes: ordinary
  race/statistic updates within the initialized license plus the core CRC.
  Neither leaderboard data nor a personal-ghost bit/payload changed.
- Identified Retro Rewind's zero-based track map and inspected its Baby Park
  expert RKGs structurally. The primary `01:15.379` stream requires Peach,
  Mach Bike, Manual and 4,759 frames; the alternate `01:26.822` stream requires
  Mario, Standard Kart M, Manual and 5,445 frames.
- Ran the matching primary metadata visibly through the existing ignored debug
  input boundary, selecting Peach, Mach Bike and Baby Park on-screen. Both
  Retro-specific Inside and Outside transmission variants consumed the full
  stream but diverged and remained at race stage 2. The alternate stream also
  diverged. No finish was forced and the save stayed byte-identical at
  `7279ad4d...`.
- Classification: **Rejected diagnostic, with useful narrowing.** Packaged
  ghost playback cannot stand in for a fast live-player record on this build.
  The next record/save/reload attempt must use ordinary controller steering or
  first diagnose the offline replay-to-live-player divergence. All temporary
  RKG and trace markers were removed, and the visible emulator was left at the
  clean production chooser.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind fast live record and storage correction

- Returned to the visible API 36 ARM64 emulator and drove GCN Baby Park with
  the Android InputReader-visible virtual Xbox controller. A revised bounded
  feedback driver completed the live run at finish stage 4 in `02:31.465`, with
  three valid recorded lap splits and no guest-memory or finish-state writes.
- The result flow displayed `A ghost has been created for KartPad!` and placed
  `02:31.465` ahead of the prior `17:13.562` result. Advancing results changed
  the redirected RKSYS from `7279ad4d...` to CRC-valid `9c6c7b52...`; its 11
  changed bytes were still ordinary statistics plus the core CRC, with a zero
  base-game personal-ghost bitfield.
- Corrected the interpretation by inspecting Retro Rewind's Pulsar storage.
  Course key `d6cac6a4` identifies GCN Baby Park, and its separate custom-track
  database now contains `150/2m31s465.rkg` beside the earlier retained
  `150/17m13s562.rkg`. The updated 4,544-byte `ldb.pul` names GCN Baby Park.
  These files survived force-stop and a new process launched through the
  production chooser; the base game's 32-slot RKSYS fields are not the source
  of truth for Retro's expanded course set.
- Classification: **Pass for repeatable ordinary-controller completion and
  durable Retro custom-track ghost storage across cold relaunch.** A fully
  visible cold selection/replay of the personal ghost remains open, as do
  trustworthy timing, physical controller/audio/rumble, physical hardware,
  and release acceptance. The emulator was left visibly running at the clean
  production chooser; no APK, AAB, game data, save, trace, or screenshot was
  published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro Rewind cold personal replay

- From the clean production chooser, selected Retro Rewind and navigated with
  the Android InputReader-visible controller to 150cc Time Trials, GCN Baby
  Park. The fresh process displayed the persisted `KartPad 02:31.465` personal
  card as `1/2`, correcting the earlier wrong-course `1/1` observation.
- Selected the card's Replay action. The cold-loaded stream visibly advanced
  around Baby Park and reached the exact `02:31.465` result with its original
  `00:35.374`, `00:30.012`, and `00:26.009` recorded splits. No live steering
  driver or debug RKG fixture was present.
- After replay, RKSYS remained `9c6c7b52...`, Baby Park `ldb.pul` remained
  `638186a6...`, and `2m31s465.rkg` remained `1858e595...`. The new-process
  console SHA-256 was `8f456db1...` and contained no fatal signature.
- Classification: **Pass for visible production-path cold personal-ghost
  selection and full replay on the emulator.** Physical controller/device,
  trustworthy timing, audio/rumble quality, and release acceptance remain
  open. No APK, AAB, game data, save, trace, console, or screenshot was
  published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 Retro runtime lifecycle

- With the cold personal replay result still visible, forced the emulator from
  rotation 0 to rotation 180. Android delivered `surfaceChanged`, rendering
  remained intact, and the game process retained PID 12558.
- Sent HOME and observed `onPause`, `surfaceDestroyed`, and `onStop`. Bringing
  the existing singleTask forward was a hot task resume, not a new launch; it
  delivered `onStart`, `onResume`, `surfaceCreated`, and `surfaceChanged`, and
  restored the exact Retro result screen in the same PID.
- Restored the emulator to automatic rotation 0. RKSYS, Baby Park `ldb.pul`,
  and `2m31s465.rkg` remained byte-identical at `9c6c7b52...`, `638186a6...`,
  and `1858e595...`, and PID-scoped logcat contained no fatal signature.
- Classification: **Pass for Retro runtime landscape rotation and full
  background/foreground surface recreation on the emulator.** This is not
  physical-device, physical-controller, audio/rumble-quality, performance, or
  release acceptance. No APK, AAB, game data, save, log, or screenshot was
  published.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 fresh offline save initialization

- Reproduced the clean redirected-NAND failure visibly on the standalone API
  36 ARM64 emulator. Retro created a correctly sized but all-zero RKSYS and
  reported that Wii system memory could not be written or read.
- Narrow instrumentation showed that file creation/preallocation succeeded,
  while the following virtual-device open failed after two `-42` operations.
  The offline preference was rejecting all `/dev/net/*` devices before
  classification, including local Wii KD request/time and NCD services needed
  by first-run save initialization.
- Added a common runtime patch that keeps those KD/NCD services available when
  online networking is disabled while preserving the offline gate for IP and
  SSL. Also retained an Android NAND semantic correction that removes the
  unrelated create-on-open fallback. All temporary tracing was removed.
- A fully fresh runtime preparation and clean Android build passed. The local
  APK SHA-256 is
  `262d821e6b2b769872df50e48e16a36b8c636b528bc9c1d03a17ae37624baaa7`,
  its package/privacy audit passed, and its native library has no save-trace
  markers.
- Two independent fresh redirected-NAND cold launches visibly reached the
  Retro Rewind title and generated the exact known-valid 2,867,200-byte empty
  RKSYS at SHA-256
  `708c7a040e0cfe6cd815690e63f46d1678f17899bce0e786f7480030830f1d13`.
  Cold relaunch passed. The original base and Retro saves were restored and
  retained their exact pre-test hashes after a final launch.
- Classification: **Pass for fresh offline Retro system-memory creation and
  cold title relaunch on the emulator.** Controller-driven new-license
  creation, physical hardware/controller, audio/rumble quality, performance,
  and release acceptance remain open. The standalone emulator was left visibly
  running at the clean Retro title; no private data or application package was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-fresh-save-offline-kd.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A3 first license from clean save

- Continued on the unchanged clean APK with the standalone emulator still
  visible. Registered the temporary Xbox-compatible `/dev/uinput` device;
  Android InputReader exposed it as `/dev/input/event12` with keyboard,
  gamepad, joystick, external, and Xbox-layout classification.
- Preserved the exact active Retro save app-privately and substituted the
  exact game-created empty RKSYS from the fresh-save pass. Ordinary controller
  input advanced through the title, first `NEW` slot, creation confirmation,
  KartPad Mii selection, and final `Your new license is ready` screen.
- The created 2,867,200-byte save changed to SHA-256
  `4b83dc4a02dd351d1e594b1c9c13ecd7530e6c80520957d4c576c46c88b0972d`.
  Read-only inspection validated its `RKSD0006` header, slot-zero `RKPD`, and
  exact stored/calculated core CRC-32 `21a244ff`.
- After force-stop and production-chooser cold relaunch, the save remained
  byte-identical and the first license card visibly displayed the KartPad Mii
  and name. The test-created state was retained only in ignored app-private
  storage, the original Retro save was restored to exact SHA-256 `9c6c7b52...`,
  and a final clean Retro launch reached the title.
- Classification: **Pass for controller-driven first license creation and
  byte-stable cold license reload from a clean emulator save.** This is not
  physical-controller/device, audio/rumble, performance, or release evidence.
  The emulator was left visibly running; no application package, save, private
  input, or screenshot was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a3-fresh-save-offline-kd.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 touch overlay and guest input

- Added a transparent Canvas-owned phone overlay with stable pointer ownership,
  the complete Classic control set, lifecycle clearing, normalized stick state,
  and a native rising-edge latch for short touchscreen button taps.
- Added JNI publication and an Android runtime patch that merges channel-zero
  touch buttons/left-stick state into KPAD without disturbing other physical
  controller channels. Portable and source-contract tests pass.
- Simulator execution exposed a base/dual build mismatch before touch ran: the
  first APK linked only `WiiCompiled`, so the launcher-selected Retro profile
  failed as not linked. Corrected the Android builder so preparation product and
  native target both follow the selected shard graph, then rebuilt against the
  validated dual Retro graph as `KartPadDual`.
- Reset a stale emulator `1280x720` size override. Android then reported its
  native `1080x2400` panel rotated into a real `2400x1080` logical/app frame,
  and the visible production chooser filled the wider display.
- The initial audited 119,090,830-byte dual APK at SHA-256 `0d39e63d...f268c`
  reached the Retro title with the overlay visible. A touchscreen A tap advanced
  to Select License, then D-pad Right moved the live selection to the adjacent
  NEW slot; the process remained healthy with no fatal signature.
- Corrected R from the old wide pressure-trigger geometry to the same compact
  digital pill as L. Added the iOS-parity A interaction: a one-second hold
  turns cyan, confirms through Android haptics, remains asserted after lift,
  and unlocks on the next tap. The exact final audited APK is
  `258f8002...73b3b`; live hold/unlock screenshots and the retained process
  confirm the state transition.
- Classification: **Pass for initial Android emulator touch rendering and
  A/D-pad guest input plus R and A-lock parity.** Layout editing, controller
  handoff, accessibility nodes, C-stick guest behavior, physical haptic feel,
  tablet/physical touch, motion, and physical-device acceptance remain open.
  No APK, AAB, private content, save, or screenshot was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-overlay-input.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 controller/touch handoff

- Added an activity-scoped Android input-device listener that recognizes
  gamepad and joystick sources, reconciles already-connected devices on resume,
  and unregisters on pause.
- Controller presence now clears the touch snapshot before hiding the overlay;
  removal of the final controller restores a neutral visible overlay.
- On the standalone API 36 ARM64 emulator, a temporary InputReader-visible Xbox
  controller produced app counts `0 -> 1 -> 0`. The complete overlay visibly
  hid and restored over the live Retro runtime.
- Repeated the transition after a 1.4-second A hold left acceleration visibly
  cyan and locked. Controller attach hid touch, and disconnect restored A green
  and unlocked, directly proving stale held input was cleared.
- The 119,090,830-byte local APK has SHA-256
  `f777c271082b34a9896beda816ec85134cb3d7472a73d99607b311bcc10e994f`.
  The virtual controller was disconnected after the test.
- Native and source contracts, Android lint, strict APK and repository safety
  audits, pinned source/input verification, and the Apple overlay snapshot pass.
- Classification: **Pass for controller/touch hotplug and held-input clearing
  on the emulator.** Configurable policy, physical controller/device behavior,
  touch editing, accessibility, tablet layout, and physical acceptance remain
  open. No package or private content was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-controller-handoff.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 touch settings/menu paused checkpoint

- Added the uncommitted Android touch-settings/editor slice: persistent move,
  resize, per-control Hide/Show, grouped D-pad editing, reset, presentation
  controls, configurable controller handoff, and modern C-stick direction.
- Live emulator work before the pause proved editing, persistence, reset, and
  both controller-visibility policy states with the prior incremental APK.
- Moved Z upward to separate it from X and expanded the one-item overflow into
  KartPad's iOS-derived Multiplayer, FPS, Controls, Display, Game Data & Saves,
  and diagnostics hierarchy. Live FPS/aspect/resolution, Retro management,
  multiplayer status, installation status, and bounded report sharing are
  wired. Remaining motion, custom mapping, game-data/save, and Mii work is
  disclosed in-product.
- Focused source contracts (17 tests), all 460 patch hunks, and diff whitespace
  pass. The fresh dual runtime build was interrupted after about 23 minutes at
  the user's pause request, before link/package. No current APK exists, so the
  newest Z/menu/JNI changes are not emulator-accepted or committed.
- Classification: **documented work-in-progress, not a pass.** Resume from
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-settings-menu-checkpoint.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 selector, consolidated menu, and motion steering

- Completed the paused dual build and exercised its production selector on the
  standalone API 36 ARM64 emulator. Original and installed Retro Rewind are
  explicit choices; Switch Game Version returns to that selector through an
  isolated launcher process.
- Emulator use exposed and fixed two Android-specific issues: display settings
  previously crossed the renderer thread boundary, and a message-plus-items
  AlertDialog hid every motion action. Runtime settings now use a synchronized
  render-thread consumer, and Motion Steering uses visible accessible buttons.
- Added persistent gravity motion steering with iOS-equivalent calibration,
  dead zone, sensitivity, inversion, touch-stick precedence, lifecycle clearing,
  and physical-controller priority. Virtual sensor injection proved neutral
  `0.0`, one tilt near `-0.30`, the opposite near `+0.30`, and the first tilt
  near `+0.30` after inversion. On/inverted/2.0x restored after a full process
  restart; the emulator was returned to Off/standard/1.0x and neutral.
- The exact local dual APK SHA-256 is
  `ae96d3e2bcd340b64d9b76cb6a05059bef99b90b24ac7111d159b7d4e05f51e5`.
  A fresh runtime preparation applied the full patch stack and a new CMake
  directory completed the dual build in 25m46s. That fresh artifact passed the
  strict audit and its own selector/Retro/menu/motion emulator smoke.
  Android/Apple focused contracts pass 18 tests; lint, the strict package/privacy
  audit, repository safety, all 462 patch hunks, pinned sources/input, the iOS
  overlay snapshot, and diff whitespace pass.
- Classification: **Pass for this selector/menu/display/touch-settings/motion
  emulator slice.** Custom mapping, full game-data/save and Mii management,
  accessibility nodes, tablet/physical touch and haptics, and physical-device
  acceptance remain open. No APK, AAB, private content, save, or screenshot was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-settings-menu-checkpoint.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 controller mapping parity

- Replaced the Controls submenu's disclosure-only controller mapping item with
  persistent A/B/X/Y/Z assignments, swap-on-collision behavior, accessible
  choices, connected-controller status, and reset-to-default.
- Routed the saved permutation through JNI into the live SDL snapshot before
  Classic Controller adaptation. Corrected the Android shoulder/trigger contract
  to match iOS: left shoulder is Z, left trigger is L, and right shoulder or
  trigger is R.
- On the standalone API 36 ARM64 emulator, saved A↔B, restarted the process, and
  attached an InputReader-visible virtual Xbox controller. The native producer
  and consumer both observed `1,0,2,3,4`; physical A left the Retro title
  unchanged as game B, and physical B advanced to license selection as game A.
  Defaults were restored afterward.
- The exact clean local APK SHA-256 is
  `30493adced96cad0edcb9d90354596dc59550be0522735f1356758124cb8686a`.
  A fresh runtime preparation applied all 464 hunks across 54 patches and
  reproduced the expected KPAD source. Nineteen Android/Apple source contracts,
  the native touch contract, host gamepad contract, package/privacy audit,
  repository safety, pinned sources/input, SunPad snapshot, lint, and whitespace
  checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for persisted single-controller button remapping on
  the emulator.** Multi-controller assignment/setup, game-data/save and Mii
  management, accessibility nodes, physical controllers/devices, and full menu
  parity remain open. No APK, AAB, private data, save, log, or screenshot was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-controller-mapping.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 Mii management parity

- Replaced the Game Data & Saves submenu's Mii placeholder with a live manager
  that lists validated records, imports bounded standard 74-byte `.mii` files
  through Android's document picker, stages named removals, explains the same
  no-creation boundary as iOS, and offers immediate restart.
- Reused the portable Mii parser/mutator through JNI. Kotlin owns app-private
  atomic staging, independent RNOD/CRC validation before startup application,
  timestamped backups, and sanitized errors. Pending changes are applied before
  SDL loads the translated runtime; the active database is never edited while
  the game is running.
- On the standalone API 36 ARM64 emulator, the manager initially listed one Mii.
  A generated non-personal `Android` Mii imported through DocumentsUI, staged as
  a 779,968-byte CRC-valid database, and appeared as the second named record after
  restart. The pre-import database was backed up byte-for-byte. Removing Android
  and restarting restored the exact original database SHA-256
  `6212cbf744e28d8e0687c9e8a7d8b22343ef37291b8dc5c031f04f1c45e5b3b7`;
  attempting to remove the remaining KartPad Mii was rejected in-product.
- The synthetic document and test-created backups were removed, no pending edit
  remains, and the exact clean APK SHA-256 is
  `24dbe0768dc07fa3d3cf8a27c7fcd163bff5cd53615dce5cddfc51207b580545`.
  Twenty-four focused source contracts, portable Mii/gamepad and native touch
  contracts, lint, package/privacy and repository audits, all patch hunks, pinned
  inputs, SunPad snapshot, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for Android Mii list/import/remove/restart/backup on the
  emulator.** In-app Mii creation remains intentionally unavailable as on iOS.
  Game-data/save management, accessibility nodes, multi-controller setup,
  physical controllers/devices, and full A4 parity remain open. No APK, AAB,
  private data, save, log, or screenshot was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-mii-management.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 game-data, save, and selector parity

- Replaced the remaining Game Data & Saves placeholder with direct import,
  save-preserving removal, Retro management, save backup/restore, and Mii
  actions. The isolated chooser now validates game data, blocks both profiles
  from launching without it, and provides Manage Game Data as the recovery path.
- Added bounded SAF extracted-folder traversal, RMCP01/revision/header and pinned
  main-DOL validation, same-volume staging, rollback-safe activation, atomic
  removal markers, and a narrow deletion allowlist that excludes NAND and saves.
- Added exact RKSYS export and restore with size, `RKSD0006`, and CRC-32 checks.
  Restores are staged while playing, backed up, and atomically applied before SDL.
- On the API 36 ARM64 emulator, DocumentsUI opened for both game data and saves.
  An invalid folder failed closed without changing the exact installed game data.
  The active 2,867,200-byte save exported byte-identically at SHA-256 `708c7a...`,
  restored through a selector restart, retained an exact backup, and returned to
  the Retro runtime. Removal schedule/Undo preserved both game data and save.
  Switching through the visible chooser then selected `base` and reached the
  Original attract scene.
- The exact local-only APK SHA-256 is
  `6aa904883b174940f728b672bee971a6367dc6008d7c9837eeb7cf684e043203`.
  Build, lint, strict APK/privacy audit, 24 focused contracts, native/portable
  contracts, repository safety, pinned inputs, all 464 patch hunks, the SunPad
  snapshot, and whitespace checks pass. ISO/WBFS extraction and a positive
  multi-gigabyte import run remain open. All temporary emulator files and the
  test backup were removed; no private content or package was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-game-data-save-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 touch accessibility

- Added 14 virtual accessibility children to the Canvas overlay with distinct
  labels and bounds, button clicks, four directional actions per stick, focus
  and hover handling, hidden-control filtering, and an A acceleration-lock
  action with a live state description.
- The API 36 ARM64 emulator exposed every virtual node through its real
  accessibility hierarchy. A temporary UI Automator test called the A node's
  custom action directly through `AccessibilityNodeInfo.performAction`; the
  node reported `Acceleration locked` and A visibly turned cyan. A normal tap
  restored unlocked green. TalkBack and the temporary test jar were removed.
- The exact dual local APK SHA-256 is
  `35ca72fab4c2c3737f373b25e6374daa7edfc13607d23afeaa8091e09b8c3fdf`.
  Kotlin compilation, lint, the strict package/privacy audit, 49 source
  contracts, and whitespace checks pass. Game data, save, and Mii hashes stayed
  exact. No APK, private content, log, test jar, or screenshot was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-accessibility.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 touch-settings visibility and render parity

- Added iOS's live 1x/2x/3x/4x render selector to Android Touch Control
  Settings and reorganized the landscape dialog into two columns so every
  setting, Move Controls, and Reset is visible without scrolling.
- Corrected reset scope to preserve hide-on-controller and modern C-stick
  preferences, matching iOS's separation between layout and behavior settings.
- The API 36 emulator showed every item with accessible bounds. Selecting 2x
  changed the checked node, then 1x restored the persistent value. The exact
  dual local APK is
  `0217707c7410afe19923ae868bcc058dd14d9449cf8f03b2fb4c1b60f8db931f`.
  Compilation, lint, strict package/privacy audit, 49 contracts, and whitespace
  checks pass; private game/save/Mii hashes stayed exact. No package or private
  artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-settings-visibility.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Android A4 reporting parity

- Replaced the empty Android diagnostic template with iOS-equivalent problem,
  context, and frequency fields. Share output now includes a bounded report ID
  and technical summary; GitHub output safely pre-fills the same answers and
  platform metadata through encoded query parameters.
- The API 36 emulator displayed all fields and actions with accessible bounds.
  The flow was canceled, so no chooser, browser, report, issue, or message was
  opened or sent. Private game/save/Mii hashes stayed exact.
- The exact local dual APK is
  `539d9bf73e617c052b4439db0c017d1d5bc425288d2852a7fec6146241e78577`.
  Compilation, lint, strict package/privacy audit, 49 contracts, and whitespace
  checks pass. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-reporting-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 disc-image, selector, and menu parity

- Added a source-built Dolphin DiscIO JNI bridge for RMCP01 revision-zero ISO
  and WBFS documents. The Android document-picker path now extracts into bounded
  app-private same-volume staging, validates the result, and activates it
  atomically while preserving installed data on failure.
- Split game-data import into explicit raw-disc and extracted-folder actions in
  both the launcher manager and in-game Game Data & Saves submenu. The complete
  submenu also retains removal, Retro Rewind, save, and Mii management.
- Replaced Android's flat panel and stock gray mode buttons with the iOS
  selector's diagonal dark gradient, orange mark, centered title hierarchy, and
  equal rounded blue/pink cards with leading icons and styled subtitles. The
  Manage Game Data recovery action remains available as a subordinate control.
- Installed the final dual APK on the API 36 ARM64 emulator. Its selector showed
  both Original and Retro Rewind 6.12.5. A deliberately empty ISO selected
  through DocumentsUI produced a bounded in-product error, left the app alive,
  retained the exact installed `main.dol`, and left no staging residue.
- A clean 1,197-step native build, patch dry-run, Android lint, strict package/
  privacy audit, shell syntax, whitespace, and the 72-test Python suite pass
  (one skipped). The final local-only APK SHA-256 is
  `09cdb68124a1e346a003b7c3e42b75b3f6b5f9fa2dcd1a7461500f5e57fd3204`.
- Classification: **Pass for selector visibility, expanded menu actions, native
  disc-image plumbing, and rollback-safe invalid-import behavior on the
  emulator.** A positive multi-gigabyte ISO/WBFS import remains open because no
  owned source image was available. No package or private artifact was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-disc-image-selector-menu-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 Pixel Tablet overlay parity

- Added a reproducibly pinned API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet AVD and made the common
  fixture runner understand its naturally different orientation sensor axis.
- Replaced stretched phone controls on large Android tablets with the accepted
  iPad sizes and normalized centers. Final frames are safe-area bounded, so the
  280 dp R trigger remains completely operable on the narrower Pixel Tablet.
- A visible 2560x1600 source-only render matched the iPad control family. UI
  Automator exposed all 14 named targets; R measured exactly 560 px at 320 dpi
  with bounds `[2000,950][2560,1075]`.
- The real chooser also passed a visible Pixel Tablet inspection: its two-column
  Original/Retro composition, title hierarchy, and recovery action remained
  centered and unclipped at 2560x1600.
- The full tablet cold-boot fixture passed guarded 4 GiB memory, scheduler and
  controller contracts, Dawn/Vulkan readback/presentation, reverse-landscape
  recreation, three background/foreground cycles, and the new hit-map gate.
  The source-only APK SHA-256 is
  `25890fbfc3e43a247dc6ebfc6165db37a8ba857e374040229178f5c56219ae62`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical tablet geometry and emulator hit-map/
  lifecycle coverage.** Physical tablet ergonomics and a touch-only race remain
  open. No package, private content, save, raw log, UI dump, or screenshot was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-tablet-overlay-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 controller player setup

- Added Controller Player Setup to Android's Controls submenu and exposed a
  bounded production Aurora/JNI bridge for connected-controller enumeration,
  persistent Player 1--4 assignment, occupied-slot replacement, and clearing.
- Added a source-only two-controller fixture rather than representing emulator
  devices as physical hardware. On the visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet, the
  accessible dialog assigned distinct P1/P2 controllers, moved P1 into occupied
  P2 while clearing the old slot, and explicitly cleared P2.
- A fresh dual-runtime preparation reproduced the patch. The complete translated
  runtime compiled and linked; its strict-audited local APK SHA-256 is
  `b41b7b3b33a9c3eec2e8a66d0a9d11e8f96d71a4be6d05e727a57fc83ca5a14c`.
  Android lint, 17 focused contracts, the 74-test suite (one skipped), repository
  safety, privacy/package, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for emulator Player 1--4 setup UI and assignment
  semantics.** Physical multi-controller input, reconnect identity, handoff,
  rumble, and physical-device acceptance remain open. No package or private
  artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-controller-player-setup.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 selector owned icon parity

- Replaced Android's legacy compass, directions, and undo assets with
  KartPad-owned steering-wheel, checkered-flag, and go-backward vectors matching
  the current iOS selector source.
- The visible 2560x1600 Pixel Tablet showed the complete centered selector and
  bounded accessible rows with the new icon language. The local screenshot
  remains untracked at SHA-256 `d0b259f3...`.
- The complete translated dual-runtime APK rebuilt and passed the strict audit
  at SHA-256
  `0d0dccc38878a9937a09d3b770dad16792654c1d5c86d72edafbd98710b778f7`.
  The 74-test suite (one skipped), lint, safety, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for owned selector icon parity on the emulator.** No
  package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-selector-owned-icons.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 selector visual contract

- Added a production-gated source-fixture state and standard-library raw RGBA
  verifier for the real launch activity. It checks selector labels, mark size,
  centered equal cards, exact iOS-derived blue/pink fills, viewport/format, and
  the diagonal navy-to-wine gradient.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel 6 passed at 2400x1080 with 973 px cards; the
  visible Pixel Tablet passed at 2560x1600 with 742 px cards. A first tablet run
  correctly exposed a phone-only rotation assumption; the final wrapper uses
  each pinned device's native landscape rotation.
- The complete translated dual-runtime APK rebuilt and passed strict audit at
  SHA-256
  `2244ca5d1cf74d85d1b98279f36aa67a165e30dd3510c05612beb48a7b58da94`.
  Android lint, 74 tests (one skipped), safety, syntax, and whitespace pass.
- Classification: **Pass for automated selector visual coverage on canonical
  emulator phone/tablet lanes.** Touch-overlay goldens and physical screens
  remain separate. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-selector-visual-contract.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 four-pointer replay

- Added a production-gated source fixture that sends real four-pointer Android
  events through the laid-out left stick, A, R, and Z controls and checks the
  normal published Classic mask and analog state after every transition.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet both passed exact
  `steer=0.75`, `all=0x214`, `afterA=0x204`, `afterZ=0x200`,
  `steerOnly=0x0`, and `neutral=0x0` states. Steering remained active until its
  own pointer lifted and the final pointer-owner table was empty.
- The complete translated dual-runtime APK rebuilt and passed strict audit at
  SHA-256
  `205abbb668872500975e734ca52f3132fb18122e80905c35211883f01b4c5967`.
  Android lint, 86 tests (one skipped), safety, syntax, and whitespace pass.
- Classification: **Pass for automated four-pointer gameplay ownership on
  canonical emulator phone/tablet lanes.** Physical digitizer/haptic feel and
  touch-only races remain open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-multipointer-replay.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 real motion-sensor flow

- Added a debug/source-only flow that enables the production motion owner,
  requires successful Android gravity-sensor registration, and changes the
  emulator's real accelerometer vector.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet runs both converted one tilt to positive
  steering in standard mode and negative steering in an independent inverted
  process. The script restores the original sensor vector on exit.
- The translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `79eb1ac8da137b63e9060ae08f688a63bade1fb19777a25d85330bf6d1ef0750`;
  strict package/privacy audit, Android lint, and 89 tests with one intentional
  skip passed.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator SensorManager registration and
  standard/inverted steering direction.** Physical steering feel, latency,
  sensor noise, and motion-assisted racing remain open. No package or private
  artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-motion-sensor-flow.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 repeatable accessibility actions

- Added a debug/source-only fixture that calls the production virtual
  `AccessibilityNodeProvider` rather than relying on a temporary external jar.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet runs focus A, pulse B, move the left stick
  right and wait for neutral, lock A, verify its accessibility state, unlock
  through the normal A click, clear focus, and finish neutral.
- Each lane reports four virtual-key haptic dispatches and the exact marker
  `focus=A b=pulse move=right lock=on click=unlock haptics=4 neutral=true`.
- The translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `40907268f2b4047e93e8e0e7e7affacc0d02e5f84fa75a7461f81ab9b21d44b9`;
  strict package/privacy audit, Android lint, and 88 tests with one intentional
  skip passed.
- Classification: **Pass for repeatable canonical emulator accessibility-node
  actions.** Physical screen-reader usability and tactile haptic feel remain
  open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-04/android/a4-touch-accessibility.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch hit map

- Added a debug/source-only real-event fixture that resolves every one of 14
  control centers and near-edge points against the actual laid-out overlay.
- A real `ACTION_DOWN` at empty gameplay center must remain unconsumed with no
  pointer owner and a neutral published Classic button state.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet runs both passed
  `centers=14 edges=14 outside=passed`.
- The translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `7edb51da87682525093db9cedcd80d1eab795572371443d4aa4a8f857f16ac6e`;
  strict package/privacy audit, Android lint, and 87 tests with one intentional
  skip passed.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator hit maps and empty-space
  pass-through.** Physical digitizer behavior and touch-only racing remain
  open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-hit-map.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 selector, menu, and touch visual parity

- Removed the Android-only Manage Game Data control from the mode chooser and
  made both iOS-equivalent cards actionable without installed data. A selected
  profile now enters the shared importer and is retained for a successful
  return; the no-data selector still settles its Retro Rewind version subtitle.
- Added six KartPad-owned menu vectors and applied symbols to switching,
  multiplayer, FPS, Controls, Display, Game Data & Saves, reporting, and their
  submenu actions. API 29+ forces symbols visible; API 28 retains the complete
  functional text hierarchy.
- Added a source-only raw RGBA/accessibility verifier for the touch overlay.
  The visible Pixel 6 passed all 14 targets, a 32 px X/Z gap, equal 237 px L/R
  pills, and palette checks. The visible Pixel Tablet passed all 14 targets, its
  iOS-derived reversed X/Z ordering with a 212 px gap, the exact 560 px R pill,
  grouped D-pad geometry, and palette checks.
- On the visible Pixel Tablet, the selector contract passed at 2560x1600; an
  empty-data card tap opened Game Data & Saves. The iconized top menu rendered
  all seven destinations/sections, and opening Controls exposed all five
  control routes.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt. Android lint, 77 tests with one
  intentional skip, repository safety, strict package/privacy audit, and
  whitespace checks pass. That final APK's settled selector was also visibly
  rechecked after installation on the same Pixel Tablet. Its SHA-256 is
  `5c0554814023e3cd80c035a5b2c21c882e2bfce511e2c780c817e6e53279eaf9`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator selector interaction, iconized
  consolidated menu, and phone/tablet touch visual contracts.** Physical touch,
  haptics, vendor rendering, and touch-only race acceptance remain open. No
  package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-selector-menu-touch-visual-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch modal and lifecycle clearing

- Added a production-gated source fixture that sends a real A-button
  `MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN` through the normal overlay, requiring `0x10` and one
  pointer owner before any clear is accepted.
- Opening the actual three-dot menu passed on the visible Pixel Tablet and
  Pixel 6: both changed held A to neutral and removed the final pointer owner.
- A separate Pixel 6 run armed the same held touch, sent Android Home, and
  passed through the normal `onPause` path with neutral state and zero owners.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt. Android lint, 79 tests with one
  intentional skip, strict package/privacy audit, repository safety, shell
  syntax, and whitespace checks pass. The local-only APK SHA-256 is
  `760b440accaaf430b13f3346cae39632411cb53a678b288c12694059152b43b3`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator modal clearing and phone
  lifecycle clearing.** OEM lifecycle ordering and physical touch remain
  physical-device gates. No package or private artifact was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-modal-lifecycle-clearing.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch state persistence

- Added a production-gated source fixture that writes A position `(0.55,0.55)`,
  A size `1.25`, and B hidden through the normal touch-settings owner, then
  force-stops the app before a separate verification process starts.
- The new process refuses to pass unless it reloads all three settings, places
  A at the corresponding safe-frame center, and omits B from the virtual
  accessibility tree. Fixture preferences reset after verification.
- The visible Pixel 6 passed with A center `1378,588`; the visible Pixel Tablet
  passed with A center `1408,866`. Both retained A size 1.25 and hidden B.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt. Android lint, 80 tests with one
  intentional skip, strict package/privacy audit, repository safety, shell
  syntax, and whitespace checks pass. The local-only APK SHA-256 is
  `254b2614f7ae17d24a1547563b77f543bafd996f0f7030a7d3cad3266d70df61`.
- Classification: **Pass for per-control position, size, and visibility across
  process restart on canonical phone/tablet emulators.** Update-in-place and
  physical-device persistence remain separate gates. No package or private
  artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-state-persistence.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 Touch Control Settings visual contract

- Added a debug/source-only launcher fixture for the real Touch Control
  Settings dialog plus a standard-library accessibility/raw-frame verifier.
- The gate requires all iOS-parity render, opacity, size, controller-hiding,
  C-stick, move, reset, and Done controls in the viewport; it also checks the
  default 1x selection and the landscape two-column composition.
- The visible Pixel Tablet passed at 2560x1600 and the visible Pixel 6 passed at
  2400x1080. A first tablet attempt exposed an API 36 UiAutomation registration
  collision from rapid dumps; bounded three-second retries resolved the test
  harness failure without changing the product dialog.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt locally at APK SHA-256
  `188c235d9a324a84e0fee38cc37ec192687741da4273616f83028a9ab5b8ff93`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator dialog visibility,
  accessibility, containment, and composition.** Physical-device rendering,
  touch feel, and editor ergonomics remain open. No package or private artifact
  was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-settings-visual-contract.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch layout editor flow

- Added a debug/source-only end-to-end fixture for the production touch layout
  editor controls.
- The real Move Controls button enters editing, a real Android down/up event on
  rendered A selects it, Hide/Show updates and restores its persisted state,
  selected sizing propagates to 1.25x, and the real Back button must reopen
  Touch Control Settings.
- The visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet both passed the exact
  `selected=A hide=shown size=1.25 back=settings` sequence. Disposable fixture
  preferences reset after success.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt locally at APK SHA-256
  `8d4bf7f24fd411edfa1a957dada33dfd425de495bbf6a53e2ce9570493c66c40`.
- Classification: **Pass for the canonical emulator editor control round
  trip.** Physical finger-drag ergonomics and touch-only races remain open. No
  package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-editor-flow.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch acceleration-lock replay

- Added a debug/source-only timed real-event fixture for holding A through the
  production touch overlay.
- Both visible canonical emulator lanes remained unlocked at 900 ms, changed
  to cyan/accessibility-locked A at about 1.1 seconds, issued exactly one
  Android virtual-key haptic request, retained locked A after release, and
  returned neutral after the next A tap.
- Pixel Tablet passed at 1106 ms and Pixel 6 at 1102 ms. This proves Android
  haptic dispatch, not physical vibration strength or subjective feel.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt locally at APK SHA-256
  `f970b77c37030d2f0d4eb48ed770bb7309ccd866fbae18e4d7553465f510c505`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator acceleration-lock timing,
  state, and dispatch.** Physical haptic feel and touch-only races remain open.
  No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-gas-lock-replay.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 Display menu label parity

- Replaced Android's generic aspect choices with the iOS-equivalent Original
  4:3 and explicit Experimental labels for 16:9 and Fill Screen.
- Replaced `Native (1x)`/ASCII scale rows with the iOS-equivalent `1× (Native)`
  through `4×` labels without changing their setting indices.
- Traversed the real Pixel 6 three-dot popup into Display, Aspect Ratio, and
  Render Resolution. All exact rows were visible and bounded; 1x Native was
  selected by default after clearing fixture preferences.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt locally at APK SHA-256
  `3a14664a60a3f656a0f46e669ef575b9f2a67d0797c099fbb3e5f08bb9ce1934`.
- Classification: **Pass for iOS-equivalent Display labels and real emulator
  traversal.** Physical rendering/performance acceptance is unchanged. No
  package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-display-menu-label-parity.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch editor drag and reset

- Strengthened the real editor flow with an A-button down/move/up drag that
  requires both rendered position and normalized persisted origin to match.
- The same flow now activates Reset This Device Layout and its real positive
  confirmation, then requires A's dragged origin and 1.25x size to return to
  defaults while remaining shown.
- An initial Pixel 6 check ran before Android's queued dialog callback and
  correctly saw the pre-reset values. Moving verification to the next main-loop
  turn models the real callback ordering; Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet then passed
  the exact `selected=A dragged=A hide=shown size=1.25 back=settings
  reset=defaults` sequence.
- The complete translated runtime rebuilt locally at APK SHA-256
  `8cc43a1f0ab1889caaeee4010322e48295bc5b599f36658d52d9e2b12c6cab33`.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator drag persistence and confirmed
  device-layout reset.** Physical finger ergonomics and touch-only races remain
  open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-editor-drag-reset.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 settings state and selector geometry

- Added a source-only real-widget fixture for render resolution, opacity,
  global size, controller hiding, and Modern C-stick, followed by force-stop
  and independent-process verification on Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet.
- The fixture's JNI receiver proved the selected 3x scale reached the native
  display-setting boundary. The comparison also corrected Android's fresh
  aspect default from Fill Screen to iOS's Original 4:3 without changing stored
  user choices.
- Replaced Android's edge-stranded compound card symbols with accessible
  centered icon/label groups and matched iOS's exact stack gaps, card insets,
  card height, body size, and upward offset.
- Strengthened the selector verifier to check that geometry and content
  centering. Both visible canonical emulator lanes pass, and a real tablet tap
  selected the base profile.
- The translated dual-runtime APK was installed and its production selector
  rendered on the visible tablet. Its SHA-256 is
  `a221911feec75a9eb295fa418980635f8811fa64524269e7b7f610cf56391abe`.
  Android lint, 85 tests with one skip, strict audit, repository safety, shell
  syntax, and whitespace pass.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator global-setting persistence and
  iOS-derived selector geometry.** Physical rendering/touch/haptic acceptance
  remains open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-settings-state-selector-geometry.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 menu hierarchy reachability

- Added a source-only emulator gate that opens the real three-dot menu and
  traverses Controls, Display, and Game Data & Saves independently.
- Both visible canonical emulators expose the full 21-row hierarchy: 8 top,
  5 Controls, 2 Display, and 6 Game Data & Saves rows.
- The strengthened run reopens the menu for 16 representative actions and
  requires each intended destination. It also scrolls the mapping dialog to
  prove Reset/Done remain reachable and verifies the honest empty-database Mii
  and source-build disc-import boundaries. Extracted-folder import reaches
  Android DocumentsUI without selecting any data.
- From a cleared preference store, activating Show FPS Counter persists the
  expected toggled-off state rather than merely changing its visible checkmark.
- Classification: **Pass for rendered hierarchy and action reachability on
  Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet.** Physical-device actions remain open. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-menu-hierarchy-reachability.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 phone X/Z spacing

- Shifted only the untouched phone X fallback slightly left, increasing the
  canonical Pixel 6 X/Z edge gap from 32 px to 49 px while retaining Z at the
  right safe edge.
- The separate iPad-derived tablet branch remained byte-for-byte unchanged and
  retained its 212 px gap. Persisted custom origins remain authoritative.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet raw-frame/accessibility contracts passed.
- The translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `a1b88fc4f74d860ba97d530f8defff988995d73cd7fd4245617f50f4d79096bc`;
  strict package/privacy audit, Android lint, 86 tests with one intentional
  skip, repository safety, shell syntax, and whitespace passed.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator phone spacing and tablet
  regression coverage.** Physical ergonomics remain open. No package or
  private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-phone-xz-spacing.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 menu semantic icons

- Replaced reused generic row art with KartPad-owned hand, gyroscope, antenna,
  refresh, trash, and Mii vectors matching the current iOS symbol meanings.
- Strengthened the real menu traversal to require 7 top-level, 5 Controls, 2
  Display, and 6 data-submenu icons in addition to its 21 rows and 16 action
  destinations.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet menu passes remained green with the narrower
  phone submenus fully reachable.
- The translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `a5310650f970ea45ea26d7414392215fb7912915bc601401df162c9c23d4093f`;
  strict package/privacy audit, Android lint, and 86 tests with one intentional
  skip passed.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical emulator semantic icon and menu-action
  parity.** Platform-native popup styling and physical-device acceptance remain
  distinct. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-menu-hierarchy-reachability.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 touch activity recreation

- Added a source-only real `Activity.recreate()` fixture that arms held A,
  requires neutral state from the outgoing overlay, and requires the recreated
  overlay to start neutral.
- The first run exposed SDL 3's default recreation guard: after the old
  activity cleared input, SDL rejected the second activity and exited the
  process. KartPad now sets `SDL_HINT_ANDROID_ALLOW_RECREATE_ACTIVITY` through
  its linked native runtime before recreation can occur.
- The replacement overlay also reloads normalized A position, 1.25x selected
  size, and hidden B state, proving settings restoration across the new view.
- Visible Pixel 6 and Pixel Tablet runs passed in one PID per lane. The complete
  translated runtime rebuilt at APK SHA-256
  `7e85ffc806a14db2e0954f4da8481f9e8ab9f1728c3e64e2cd74203c82af87d1`.
- Android lint, 89 tests with one intentional skip, strict package/privacy
  audit, repository safety, shell syntax, and whitespace passed.
- Classification: **Pass for canonical-emulator same-process SDL activity
  recreation and touch-state/settings restoration.** Physical interruption and
  process-death acceptance remain open. No package or private artifact was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-touch-activity-recreation.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 native TLS primitive

- Reviewed the current prepared runtime and confirmed Android still selects the
  unsupported `SSL_ERR_FAILED` branch while Windows and Apple own native TLS
  implementations.
- Selected the official Mbed TLS 4.1.1 LTS release, supported through at least
  March 2029, rather than Dolphin's historical 2.28.0 snapshot. Locked its
  7,099,934-byte official archive at SHA-256
  `3359a349e23db3d5536fcee032ae7b2ecbfc08972fab643089b5cbf2a375c98c`.
- Added the dependency to the shared Android preparation/build path and a native
  ARM64 fixture requiring PSA initialization, 32 bytes of nonconstant entropy,
  `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_REQUIRED`, SSL context setup, and hostname assignment.
- The visible Pixel Tablet passed with `Mbed TLS 4.1.1`, 32 entropy bytes, and
  required verification. The exact source APK SHA-256 is
  `37e2ec9876a3e27d1914f2f8a9bdd527683dff057eb862ac2353d500d0a7983d`.
- The first fixture audit rejected Mbed TLS build paths embedded in debug
  strings. File/macro prefix mapping removed the local checkout, and the audit
  now also accounts for the exact TLS parser-delimiter multiplicity without
  allowing an additional private key block.
- The complete translated product rebuild and audit pass at SHA-256
  `56fd0ea5760f83df6240248ebb4c1a53bdf2d7e0d507fad4486d5627dd7986c0`; Android lint, 92 tests with one intentional skip,
  repository safety, shell syntax, and whitespace pass.
- Classification: **Pass for the maintained Android TLS dependency and native
  client-context primitive.** Guest SSL sessions, CA parsing, handshake and
  hostname-failure fixtures, and WFC connectivity remain open. No APK/AAB or
  private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-native-tls-primitive.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 guest TLS backend

- Replaced Android's translated `/dev/net/ssl` unsupported branch with a
  KartPad-owned Mbed TLS 4 session wrapper. Android sessions now bind the guest
  hostname, parse the guest-provided DER root CA, attach the existing native
  socket, require peer verification, and map read/write, close, socket, date,
  trust-chain, and hostname outcomes to Wii SSL result values.
- Added the change as a reproducible WiiCompiled patch and required every fresh
  Android runtime preparation to apply it. A fresh prepared tree reproduced the
  exact working `network_ssl.cpp`, and the complete translated dual product
  compiled and linked the backend.
- The first host-local exchange exposed Mbed TLS 1.3's post-handshake new-session
  ticket result. Classifying that continuation correctly produced a complete
  encrypted HTTP exchange and retained the wrong-hostname `-9` result.
- Added a dormant source-only ARM64 loopback fixture and repeatable runner. It
  creates one-run certificates outside the repository, copies only the public
  DER CA into app-private storage, and connects to the host through emulator
  alias `10.0.2.2`. The visible Pixel Tablet passed both exact markers:
  `trusted handshake passed response_bytes=4096` and
  `hostname rejection passed result=-9`.
- The exact source-fixture APK SHA-256 is
  `2deb2e52d1c980680285c910f43187c117a9bb05a880f5ef97f14efb7e56564b`.
  Its strict audit, the host TLS fixture, 94 tests with one intentional skip,
  shell syntax/lint, and whitespace checks pass. The clean translated product
  rebuild and strict audit pass at APK SHA-256
  `c978ef4619cb59756854460f992c19a2c4da99ebcb6e080eba96b4905eedc9f2`;
  that exact APK was installed and left on the visible production selector.
- Classification: **Pass for the Android guest TLS backend, deterministic
  local encrypted traffic, CA/hostname verification, failure mapping, and ARM64
  emulator execution.** This is not yet retail guest IOCTLV/WFC, built-in Wii
  CA/client certificates, interruption recovery, public service, or physical
  hardware acceptance. No APK/AAB, key, or private artifact was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-guest-tls-backend.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 translated guest TLS IOCTLV path

- Added an opt-in product-runtime fixture that snapshots a guarded guest-memory
  window and invokes the real translated SSL handler with guest vectors for
  new-session, DER root CA, runtime socket connect, handshake, write, read, and
  shutdown.
- Added a non-destructive emulator runner. It requires the exact approved
  app-private `main.dol` hash, reinstalls without clearing storage, generates
  one-run host certificates, copies only the public DER CA to the emulator,
  removes the exact fixture afterward, and restores the production selector.
- The visible Pixel Tablet consumed the complete 4,797-byte encrypted response,
  observed orderly peer close as guest `-6`, and passed the wrong-host `-9`
  path. The private game-data hash was unchanged, no key
  reached the device, and the corrected relative `[paths]` configuration
  remained installed.
- Replaced Android's false-success `SETBUILTINROOTCA` behavior with a
  size-bounded loader for the exact fixed-hash Wii `rootca.pem` in managed
  app-private NAND. Missing or wrong content now fails as guest `-1`, and
  unimplemented client-certificate commands also fail instead of claiming
  configuration. The clean emulator proves the missing-root path; valid
  user-owned root loading and mutual TLS remain open.
- A fresh runtime preparation reproduced the exact source. The product APK
  SHA-256 is
  `aa227e2b2232c2d36d86044f44a26caa310325f42ca9774216a1a62dde94df89`;
  96 tests with one intentional skip, product-configured Android lint, strict
  package/privacy audit, repository safety, shell lint/syntax, and whitespace
  checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for actual product guest-memory IOCTLV translation
  and socket-table/TLS execution on the emulator.** The fixture runs before the
  guest and is not retail Mario Kart/WFC-initiated traffic. Built-in Wii
  certificates, local/public WFC, interruption, and physical-device networking
  remain open. No APK/AAB, key, or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-guest-tls-ioctlv.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 clean APK reproducibility

- An immediate same-state product rebuild retained its APK hash, but the first
  scoped Gradle app clean produced a different outer archive. Extracting both
  packages proved all 149 entries byte-identical; only ZIP order/alignment and
  container size differed. Incremental and clean hashes are therefore not
  interchangeable.
- The app output/native object tree was cleaned independently a second time.
  Both clean builds produced byte-identical APKs at SHA-256
  `aa227e2b2232c2d36d86044f44a26caa310325f42ca9774216a1a62dde94df89`;
  direct `cmp` passed. The second clean build took 10 minutes 28 seconds.
- The first clean artifact passed the product guest TLS IOCTLV fixture and
  strict package/privacy audit before comparison. The emulator preserved the
  approved game-data hash and returned to the production selector.
- Classification: **Pass for local unsigned clean APK byte reproducibility.**
  Signed reproducibility, update-in-place/save recovery, physical acceptance,
  and release authorization remain open. No package or private artifact was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-clean-apk-reproducibility.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 emulator update-in-place preservation

- Added a non-destructive emulator runner that requires two APKs with distinct
  byte hashes, installs each with `adb install -r`, never clears package data,
  verifies the approved app-private `main.dol`, and always restores the visible
  production selector.
- The runner compares a private aggregate covering configuration, the approved
  game entry point, managed NAND, saves, shared preferences, and the Retro
  version marker without printing private state content or individual hashes.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet preserved its complete baseline state
  while replacing the incremental APK `08c016da…` with the clean reproducible
  APK `aa227e2b…`.
- Classification: **Pass for same-version emulator durable-state preservation.**
  The profile had no retail save, custom touch preferences, or installed Retro
  version, and both APKs had the same application version. Populated-state and
  version-code migration, signing, physical acceptance, and release
  authorization remain open. No APK/AAB or private artifact was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-emulator-update-in-place.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 forward-version emulator upgrade

- Added a validated positive version-code override to the product builder while
  retaining version code 1 for ordinary builds. Strengthened the replacement
  runner to verify both APKs use the exact KartPad package, confirm each
  installed version, and optionally require a strictly increasing version.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet passed version code 1-to-2, 2-to-3,
  and hardened 3-to-4 upgrades with no package-data clear. Before the second
  upgrade, the actual product menu persisted `Show FPS Counter=false`; that
  semantic preference and the full private state aggregate remained unchanged
  afterward.
- The exact version 4 fixture APK SHA-256 is
  `4efee32c73ba0f5832733d4059316d9c4389c7358f2ff71f8f15dea0e2118ed7`.
  It passed the strict package/privacy audit and remained installed with the
  production selector visibly resumed.
- Classification: **Pass for emulator forward-version and populated-preference
  preservation.** Retail-save, full Retro installation, signed release,
  physical-device migration, and publication remain open. No APK/AAB or
  private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-emulator-version-upgrade.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 emulator save-storage recovery

- Added a debug-only save-storage fixture using deterministic, valid synthetic
  RKSYS images entirely below an isolated app-cache root. It exercises the
  production `KartPadSaveStorage` implementation without touching a user save.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet proved exact size/magic/CRC validation,
  export-read bytes, staged restore, atomic activation, one exact prior-save
  backup, pending cleanup, and corrupt-checksum rejection.
- The non-destructive runner verifies the approved app-private game fixture,
  never clears storage, removes its cache fixture, and restores the production
  selector. The exact audited and installed version-code 5 APK SHA-256 is
  `67bc86e5c0e1ad5ea7fa9c93744a78279e046caba6a7336736fcd6d2e68cfd04`.
- Classification: **Pass for emulator save-storage and recovery semantics.**
  Android document-picker export/import, a real retail save, physical hardware,
  signed release, and publication remain open. No APK/AAB or private artifact
  was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-emulator-save-storage.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 system document-picker save round trip

- Added a guarded emulator runner for the production KartPad menu and Android
  DocumentsUI export/import path. It requires an initialized active save,
  refuses pending/recovery/public-path collisions, installs without clearing
  data, and verifies the approved app-private game fixture.
- Before UI work it creates and verifies an app-private recovery copy. Failed
  attempts retain that recovery while removing the exact public export; the
  passing run identifies and removes only its new automatic backup and exact
  recovery/public/UI artifacts.
- The visible API 36 ARM64 Pixel Tablet exported its initialized RKSYS through
  `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`, re-imported it through `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`,
  staged the validated bytes, restarted through the selector, and applied the
  pending restore before SDL startup. The export, restored active save, and
  automatic prior-save backup matched the protected original byte-for-byte.
- Classification: **Pass for end-to-end emulator DocumentsUI save
  export/import/restart recovery.** The active save remained, no private hash or
  bytes were printed, and the production selector was visibly restored.
  Physical provider/device acceptance, signed release, and publication remain
  open. No APK/AAB, save, or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-emulator-save-document-picker.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 deterministic unsigned release AAB

- Added an explicit `aab` product-builder mode and pinned official bundletool
  1.18.1 at 32,505,571 bytes and SHA-256
  `675786493983787ffa11550bdb7c0715679a44e1643f3ff980a529e9c822595c`.
- The first byte-reproducible unsigned debug intermediary failed strict privacy
  review because `base/resources.pb` contained absolute Gradle-cache paths. A
  clean rebuild with general path mapping reproduced the same failure, ruling
  out stale output.
- Moved the AAB lane to unsigned `bundleRelease` and enabled release
  resource-source exclusion. The complete resulting AAB and `resources.pb`
  contain no developer path.
- Two independent scoped app cleans and release product builds produced
  byte-identical AABs at SHA-256
  `f1c107a7b2cf853f77ef245164821fa46e3502a83be8a3881d794edca7cf9e3e`.
  Pinned bundletool validation and strict package/manifest/permission,
  ARM64-only, 16 KiB ELF, export/dependency, asset, private-data/path, and exact
  key-marker audits pass.
- Classification: **Pass for clean unsigned release AAB reproducibility and
  audit.** Signing, store-derived APK execution, physical acceptance, and
  publication remain open. No APK/AAB or private artifact was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-clean-unsigned-aab.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 bundle-derived release APK execution

- Added a guarded emulator runner that audits the exact unsigned AAB, preserves
  a recoverable copy of the installed debug package, uses pinned bundletool to
  make a locally debug-signed universal APK, verifies that APK is
  non-debuggable, and audits it before installation.
- The first gate rejected bundletool's two generated `assets/dexopt` baseline-
  profile files. They map exactly to the AAB's two AGP profile metadata entries;
  the APK audit now accepts the complete exact pair if either appears and no
  additional asset.
- Release correctly denied ADB direct access to its non-exported gameplay
  activity. The final runner enters through the exported KartPad selector,
  locates the real Original-card bounds, waits for asynchronous validation to
  enable it, and taps it as a user would.
- The visible Pixel Tablet presented both game cards and SDL reported execution
  of `SDL_main` from the installed ARM64 `libmain.so`. The exact derived APK
  SHA-256 is
  `ebfcbd0c8fc1471451e72b226480b3792c0a217938b482b705790311e143ac2e`;
  its source AAB remains
  `f1c107a7b2cf853f77ef245164821fa46e3502a83be8a3881d794edca7cf9e3e`.
- The runner restored the prior version-code 5 debug APK, proved the private
  durable-state aggregate unchanged, removed its exact temporary output, and
  restored the production selector.
- The focused contract, 103-test Python suite with one intentional skip,
  strict AAB audit, source/input verification, repository safety, shell
  syntax/lint, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for locally signed, bundle-derived, non-debuggable
  universal APK execution and update preservation on the emulator.** Play
  split delivery, release-candidate signing, physical hardware, and publication
  remain open. No package or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-bundle-derived-apk-emulator.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 versioned local hardware preview

- Replaced the stale `0.0.1-a0` Android version name with the explicit
  `0.4.0-android-preview.1` default and added validated version-name overrides
  to Gradle and the product builder. Strict APK/AAB audits now require the
  expected name.
- Built version code 6, forward from the populated emulator's installed version
  5. Two independent scoped cleans and release bundle builds matched exactly at
  SHA-256
  `eaf16573290b5e27c161e47ede4641944545d7e8deb07c20671c185df7996110`.
- The bundle-derived gate performed the real version 5-to-6 update, confirmed a
  non-debuggable package, traversed the enabled production selector, and
  executed `SDL_main` from installed ARM64 `libmain.so`. It restored version 5
  and proved the private durable-state aggregate unchanged.
- Retained the exact audited 90,477,735-byte, locally debug-signed ARM64/API-28+
  hardware-preview APK outside Git at
  `.android-bootstrap/hardware-preview/KartPad-0.4.0-android-preview.1-v6-arm64.apk`.
  Its SHA-256 is
  `24e977d497d5c587eb79771d09e3176932633fe0671f6e5444ddca335bc8bd92`.
- The 103-test suite with one intentional skip, strict AAB and retained-APK
  audits, pinned-source/input verification, repository safety, shell
  syntax/lint, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for versioned clean AAB reproducibility, local preview
  derivation, and forward emulator upgrade/runtime preservation.** Physical
  hardware, release-key signing, Play split delivery, and publication remain
  open. The preview contains no game data and no package or private artifact
  was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-versioned-hardware-preview.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 device-specific split APK execution

- Extended the guarded bundle-derived runner to query the connected emulator's
  real device specification and produce a targeted APK set with pinned
  bundletool after the universal release path passes.
- The Pixel Tablet set contained exactly base, ARM64, English, and xhdpi APKs.
  All four passed signature and 16 KiB-aware alignment checks, shared one
  signer, and the ABI split's four native libraries matched the audited AAB
  bytes exactly.
- Package Manager installed exactly four components. The production selector
  showed both games, Original launched through its enabled card, and SDL
  executed the installed ARM64 `libmain.so` from the split form.
- The runner suppressed tool-internal temporary paths, restored debug version
  5 and the visible selector, removed its exact device spec/APK set/splits, and
  proved the private durable-state aggregate unchanged.
- The 103-test suite with one intentional skip, strict AAB/preview-APK audits,
  pinned-source/input verification, repository safety, shell syntax/lint, and
  whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for local device-specific split selection, audit,
  install, and native execution.** Actual Play service delivery, release-key
  signing, physical hardware, and publication remain open. No package, split,
  device spec, private artifact, or identifier was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-device-split-emulator.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 guarded physical-preview handoff

- Added `scripts/install-android-hardware-preview.sh` to bind the exact audited
  preview APK to the existing physical preflight and UID-scoped capture flow.
- It refuses emulators or unsupported/ambiguous targets before mutation,
  requires the approved digest, strict APK audit, installed preview metadata,
  and visible two-game selector, then starts the physical capture marker.
- Any different existing KartPad package requires explicit update opt-in. The
  script never uninstalls, clears app data, or downgrades; a signing mismatch
  fails without removing the prior package. Raw ADB failure output and the
  target serial are suppressed.
- A live negative run against the sole connected Pixel Tablet emulator failed
  at the physical preflight as intended, emitted no serial, and left installed
  version 5 unchanged. The source contract passed.
- The 104-test suite with one intentional skip, strict AAB/preview-APK audits,
  source/input verification, repository safety, shell syntax/lint, and
  whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for guarded physical-preview installation handoff,
  not physical execution.** No phone is attached; gameplay, performance,
  touch, motion, audio, haptics, controller, thermal, lifecycle, and long-soak
  hardware rows remain open. No package or private artifact was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-physical-preview-handoff.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 product runtime on 16 KiB kernel

- Identified that full product packages had 16 KiB alignment but only source
  fixtures had actually executed on the pinned 16,384-byte kernel lane.
- Created a separate disposable API 35 ARM64 Pixel 7 AVD and transferred only
  the approved GameData/runtime configuration/resources from the persistent
  tablet. Every regular-file content hash matched through one private aggregate;
  saves, logs, preferences, and unrelated state were excluded.
- The first fresh-state preservation run correctly detected selector-created
  default preferences. The runner now initializes the debug selector before
  baseline capture and can report only changed category names on mismatch.
- Strengthened release execution beyond `SDL_main`: the same PID must survive
  at least 15 seconds, SDL surface and low-latency audio must initialize, the
  accessible KartPad Menu must exist, no fatal signature may appear, and a
  private frame must cross content-free color/luma/nonblack thresholds within a
  bounded retry window.
- Universal and four-part device-split version 6 packages passed every stronger
  gate at page size 16,384, restored debug version 5, and preserved durable
  state. The identical gate then passed again at page size 4,096 on the
  persistent Pixel Tablet.
- Deleted the exact temporary AVD, restricted 2.7 GB transfer, recovery APK,
  device specs/splits, private frames, and raw log. The persistent tablet ends
  on the visible two-game selector.
- The 106-test suite with one intentional skip, strict AAB/preview-APK audits,
  source/input verification, repository safety, Python/shell syntax, shell
  lint, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for complete non-debuggable product runtime and
  rendering on Android 16 KiB and 4 KiB emulator kernels.** Physical hardware,
  vendor Vulkan/performance, hands-on audio/haptics/controller, signing, and
  publication remain open. No package or private artifact was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-product-16k-runtime.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 API 28 product-runtime probe

- Created a disposable official API 28 `google_apis` ARM64 AVD and privately
  verified all 4,185 restricted product-fixture files after staging.
- Hardened page-size probing for Android 9's missing `getconf`, routed
  app-private existence checks through the shell, and made early process loss
  produce the runner's explicit bounded diagnostic.
- The release selector, ARM64 `SDL_main`, SDL surface, and audio initialized,
  but the image's Vulkan inventory was empty. Dawn returned
  `VK_ERROR_INCOMPATIBLE_DRIVER` under default and explicit host-GPU modes;
  Aurora then correctly stopped on its fatal null-renderer path.
- Classification: **Blocked by this official emulator image's unusable Vulkan
  implementation; not an API 28 pass and not a physical-device failure.** API
  28 remains provisional pending Vulkan-capable physical hardware.
- Restored debug version 5, deleted the temporary AVD, restricted transfer,
  trace, and private log, then restarted the API 36 tablet on its selector. No
  APK/AAB or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-api28-product-runtime-probe.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 API 29 Vulkan compatibility and preview 2

- The official API 29 ARM64 image exposed a usable Vulkan adapter, but the
  existing product stalled on a nearly black frame. Native stacks localized a
  deadlock to concurrent Dawn pipeline creation and submission in Goldfish's
  Vulkan handle mapping.
- Serializing both pipeline and frame work avoided the deadlock but overflowed
  SDL's small native thread during synchronous compilation, so that broad
  workaround was rejected. The final patch disables only Aurora's priority
  pipeline-worker pool on API 29 and lower; asynchronous frame submission and
  presentation remain enabled, and API 30+ behavior is unchanged.
- Fresh preparation reproduced the patch. The corrected API 29 runtime stayed
  alive, rendered diverse frames through 60 seconds, completed 1,214-pipeline
  prewarm, and reached later telemetry near 60 FPS without a bounded fatal
  signature.
- Promoted the local preview to `0.4.0-android-preview.2`, version code 7. Two
  scoped clean release builds produced byte-identical AABs at SHA-256
  `d03f1791989142e109f2a3101a3bca629e80d3b8b1fdde54269b17b21d554f4a`.
  The retained 90,477,735-byte non-debuggable universal APK is
  `cfb32065650a15e9d3ddab9aa2705ea62e9930626445c7e568e1ef29b8e53420`.
- Universal and exact four-part device-split installs passed stable runtime,
  diverse-frame, signer/native-byte, upgrade, and durable-state gates on API
  29. The identical AAB passed the complete gate again on API 36 and restored
  debug version 5 plus the visible selector.
- Deleted the disposable API 29 AVD, restricted 2.7 GB transfer, raw logs and
  frames, and temporary AAB/preparation copies. Classification: **Pass for the
  complete release product on the Android 10 emulator, with modern regression
  retained.** API 28 and every physical-device acceptance row remain open. No
  APK/AAB or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-api29-product-runtime.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 guest TLS interruption recovery

- Extended the guarded guest IOCTLV runner with a one-shot host peer that
  publishes a kernel-selected port only after listening, waits for TCP
  establishment, then aborts during TLS negotiation.
- The first attempts correctly exposed harness problems rather than product
  failures: a cached prepared source lacked the opt-in fixture; rapid relaunches
  could reuse one transcript filename; loopback binding was not reachable
  through this emulator's `10.0.2.2`; and an immediate reset could race native
  `connect()`. Fresh preparation, package-marker verification, byte-offset log
  scanning, wildcard IPv4 binding, and a bounded post-accept delay resolved
  those distinct boundaries.
- The translated `/dev/net/ssl` handler reported interrupted handshake `-5`.
  The following clean process completed the verified 4,797-byte exchange,
  observed orderly peer close as `-6`, and retained wrong-host rejection `-9`.
  The version-code 7 debug APK SHA-256 was
  `81b46c904ae2a81ed9b0a2edaa2fc2b4c472b3d70b56dbc10c3cafa69231744b`.
- Classification: **Pass for cold-process guest TLS interruption recovery on
  the API 36 emulator.** Same-process reconnect, network transitions, local or
  production WFC, and physical-device networking remain open. The runner
  preserved app-private game data, copied no key to Android, removed the exact
  fixture, and returned to the selector. No APK or private artifact was
  published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-guest-tls-interruption-recovery.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 same-process guest TLS recovery

- Added optional fixture-only recovery routing to the translated guest TLS
  gate. An expected-success handshake failure now drives production shutdown,
  cleans every Wii/native socket, restores guest scratch bytes, and enters one
  guarded recursive session against the trusted peer. Recovery cannot recurse
  again, and ordinary hostname rejection does not use it.
- A fresh complete dual-runtime preparation reproduced the updated IOCTLV and
  API 29 Vulkan patches. The packaged same-process marker was verified before
  installation; the strict-audited version-code 7 debug APK SHA-256 was
  `a5a09e08b0374810566181b59fe19d88572e2303b4327f40320dfbcedb1556dd`.
- One API 36 product fixture invocation reported primary handshake `-5`, then
  completed the trusted 4,797-byte response and orderly close `-6` from its
  second session before reporting same-process recovery. Wrong-host rejection
  remained `-9`.
- Classification: **Pass for controlled same-process translated guest TLS
  session/socket recovery on the emulator.** Network transitions, WFC
  reconnect, retail guest initiation, and physical networking remain open.
  The runner kept keys off Android, preserved game data, removed its trigger,
  restored the selector, and the temporary source was deleted. No APK or
  private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-guest-tls-same-process-recovery.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 translated guest DNS IOCTL

- Added an opt-in product fixture around the production deferred
  `SO_GETHOSTBYNAME` path. It opens `/dev/net/ip/top`, copies a Wii request from
  guarded guest memory, launches the existing detached resolver worker, and
  applies the normal Wii `hostent` encoder; the fixture does not invoke
  `getaddrinfo` directly.
- Added a bounded fixture completion route and cancellation token so an overdue
  worker cannot fabricate an IOS callback or write after guest scratch is
  restored.
- Fresh dual-runtime preparation reproduced the patch and the complete ARM64
  product built successfully. On the visible API 36 Pixel Tablet emulator,
  guest `localhost` resolved to `127.0.0.1`; canonical name, IPv4 family,
  address size, guest pointer list, and address bytes all matched.
- The exact debug APK SHA-256 is
  `5bf5018de8d8e8c2b59dfaf381bdade5668c40a890f483ca248f81ca5e244411`.
  It also repeated the translated TLS interruption, trusted exchange,
  same-process recovery, orderly close, and hostname-rejection cases.
- The 109-test suite with one intentional skip, strict APK audit, all 493 patch
  hunks, pinned source/input verification, SunPad snapshot, shell lint,
  repository safety, and whitespace checks pass.
- Classification: **Pass for deterministic translated guest DNS marshalling on
  the Android emulator.** Retail guest initiation, Retro-WFC routing, local
  WFC, network transitions, cross-client play, and physical networking remain
  open. The runner preserved app-private game data, removed the trigger, and
  restored the selector. No APK/AAB or private artifact was published.
  Evidence: `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-guest-dns-ioctl.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 isolated local-WFC server boundary

- Reconstructed the clean pinned Retro WFC server against a disposable
  PostgreSQL 17 container. The database image is locked by immutable digest,
  stores data only in a 512 MiB tmpfs, and publishes an ephemeral loopback
  database port.
- The first schema attempt exposed that upstream assigns ownership to a
  `wiilink` role it does not create. The runner now creates that non-login role
  before importing the unchanged pin and requires four public tables.
- A first automated startup then exposed a second boundary: PostgreSQL's
  temporary initialization server could satisfy `pg_isready` and shut down
  before schema import. The final gate waits for the image's init-complete
  marker plus readiness from the final server.
- The clean final cycle built server commit
  `fbd30fa41a35fe8a407e3a49bc83fe4ff91fd35b`, brought up frontend/backend RPC,
  NAS, four GameSpy TCP listeners, QR2 UDP, and NATNEG UDP, and received the
  isolated `KartPad Local WFC` NAS response from both the Mac and the API 36
  emulator through `10.0.2.2:29980`.
- Server binary SHA-256 was
  `7eac61307cf3c8e8ccad38830202c7af1a7185224905bd0702c63ee5bffccfd1`.
  No fixture container, process, listener, or temporary server directory
  remained after cleanup.
- The 110-test repository suite passes with one intentional skip, together with
  shell lint, JSON validation, 493 patch hunks, pinned source/input
  verification, repository safety, and whitespace checks.
- Classification: **Pass for pinned local-server startup and Android emulator
  reachability, not translated guest login or gameplay.** Payload/bootstrap,
  client routing/auth/profile state, matchmaking, race/results, reconnect, and
  physical Android networking remain open. No public service, APK/AAB,
  credential, or private game data was used or published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-local-wfc-server-boundary.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 dual Retro phone-emulator launch

- Preserved the storage-constrained Pixel Tablet and booted the visible API 36
  phone AVD with its 10 GiB data partition. Streamed the already approved
  Original and Retro 6.12.5 inputs directly into the app sandbox, then verified
  accepted `main.dol`, `Code.pul`, profile XML, and version values on-device.
- The first selector launch exposed that the current DNS-fixture APK was
  base-only. Its expected `selected profile is not linked` failure then exposed
  an unsafe secondary ImGui shutdown assertion before Aurora initialization.
  Added an idempotent no-context cleanup guard and rebuilt `KartPadDual`.
- The dual retry reached Vulkan/audio and the translated Retro registry, then
  correctly stopped at missing content-root configuration. The game-data
  importer already owns `dvd_root`; the successful Retro install worker now
  atomically persists its relative installed-pack root and fails closed if that
  update cannot be committed. The selector also repairs that root after
  validating a pack retained from an earlier app version.
- The exact final unpublished APK SHA-256 is
  `9c20099ab98f04dfde1d83e16fcb229936ccf7d1a596dbb0b1245ad1aa5cb4c7`.
  It reached and held the branded Retro title with the production touch overlay
  at about 34 FPS under the temporary 1280x720 performance size. Native
  2400x1080 metrics were restored and the installed selector was left visible.
- Fresh dual preparation, 110 tests with one skip, strict APK/privacy audit,
  repository safety, and whitespace checks pass. Classification: **Pass for
  dual selector-to-Retro rendered-title launch on the API 36 phone emulator and
  durable runtime-path ownership.** Physical device, online flow, performance,
  and release acceptance remain open. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-dual-retro-phone-launch.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A5 translated Retro local-WFC request

- Added a debug-only Android route owner that activates only for the Retro
  profile on `ranchu`/`goldfish`, fixes the destination to
  `10.0.2.2:29980`, and accepts no arbitrary host or port. Release builds
  cannot activate it.
- Added an opt-in hold mode to the disposable local-WFC runner plus a sanitized
  future marker for QR2 availability and the `RMCPD00` NAS payload request.
- Built and installed the complete dual runtime. Exact unpublished debug APK
  SHA-256:
  `fdb3cb3c995ddeaf1daef37acfb82dc45f1ffffe41f764fdc6362bcc21ae9a9c`.
- On the visible API 36 phone, the real translated Retro product entered
  **Retro WFC — 1 Player**, explicitly accepted its privacy prompt, sent an
  18-byte QR2 availability request, received the 7-byte response, and caused
  the isolated server to receive `GET /payload?g=RMCPD00&…`.
- The server intentionally had no executable payload or production signing
  key. It reported `Failed to read payload file`, and the game stopped at
  `20913`, narrowing the next boundary to a locally controlled payload/client
  pair with a matching test key.
- The first full-suite command omitted the repository builder module path: 89
  tests ran, then discovery failed with `ModuleNotFoundError:
  kartpad_builder`. The changed invocation used `PYTHONPATH=builder` and
  passed all 110 tests with one intentional skip. The strict APK audit, pinned
  source/input and 494-hunk patch verification, repository safety, shell lint,
  shell syntax, and whitespace checks also pass.
- Classification: **Pass for translated guest routing and first local QR2/NAS
  traffic; incomplete for payload validation, login, matchmaking, race,
  reconnect, cross-client play, and physical networking.** The prior fresh
  save was restored byte-for-byte, its temporary backup was removed, native
  display size and the visible selector were restored, and no service process,
  container, listener, or temporary directory remained. No public service or
  production key was used, and no APK/AAB or private artifact was published.
  Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a5-translated-retro-local-wfc-request.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 iOS-shaped in-game menu

- Replaced Android's platform `PopupMenu` with a right-anchored KartPad-owned
  rounded card modeled on the current iOS menu presentation.
- Added compact icon rows, separators, FPS checkmark, submenu chevrons,
  viewport-bounded scrolling, and Controls/Display/Game Data replacement pages
  with a working back header. Existing action handlers and touch-input clearing
  remain intact.
- Built the fixture and exercised the visible native 2400x1080 API 36 phone.
  The complete walker passed eight title/top rows, five Controls rows, two
  Display rows, six Game Data rows, and 16 functional action destinations.
- The repository suite passes all 110 tests with one intentional skip, plus
  changed-script lint/syntax and whitespace checks.
- The first run exposed that the legacy menu walker still used `pm clear` from
  its fixture-only era. Removed that destructive reset, made FPS/Mii assertions
  state-aware, and restored the already-approved local Retro pack after the
  run. Future menu checks preserve shared package data.
- The exact audited, unpublished `KartPadDual` debug APK SHA-256 is
  `898a03bed41a95af41537f626ffee6928b609aec397bde7643cdc48c136517d7`.
- Classification: **Pass for iOS-shaped phone-emulator menu presentation and
  complete action reachability; not physical-device, large-font,
  accessibility-service, or OEM-windowing acceptance.** No APK/AAB or private
  artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-ios-shaped-menu-surface.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 physical Vulkan/storage intake

- Changed the read-only physical gate to require Android's declared Vulkan
  version and level rather than allowing a phone with no Vulkan declaration to
  pass on an unavailable diagnostic inventory.
- Raised the one-command preview installer to a 6 GiB minimum free-space floor;
  callers may raise but cannot lower it.
- Expanded the isolated fake-ADB matrix to 13 cases with explicit no-Vulkan
  rejection. The entire contract passes with serial redaction.
- Ran the guarded installer with exact audited dual APK `898a03be…` while the
  API 36 emulator was the sole target. It rejected the emulator before install,
  retained the exact installed APK hash, and left the selector active.
- Classification: **Pass for fail-closed physical Vulkan/storage intake and
  live negative safety; not physical Android execution or acceptance.** No
  APK/AAB was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-physical-vulkan-storage-preflight.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 menu at 200% system text

- Tested the new in-game menu at Android `font_scale=2.0` on the visible native
  2400x1080 phone. The first row-height formula was rejected because the actual
  screenshot showed clipped wrapped labels.
- Replaced it with real text-width measurement at 16 sp, precise trailing-icon
  reservations, one/two-line adaptive heights, a 44 dp minimum touch target,
  and bounded two-line ellipsis. Added pause-time popup dismissal.
- The accepted top card scrolled cleanly. The Controls page exposed all five
  actions across top and bottom positions without vertical text clipping,
  including its two longest labels.
- Restored font scale 1.0, installed the new exact dual APK with `-r`, rechecked
  the retained Retro/save hashes, and left the selector active. The temporary
  backup APK and setting marker were moved to Trash.
- Exact audited unpublished dual APK SHA-256:
  `bbb0d08deb58017bd68a354037b232d1449c77a54fa28c120baaae8e9cb659f4`.
  The 110-test suite passes with one skip, along with package/privacy and
  repository safety/whitespace audits.
- Classification: **Pass for 200% text containment/reachability on the API 36
  phone emulator; not TalkBack, switch access, tablet/OEM font, or physical
  hardware acceptance.** No APK/AAB was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-menu-large-text.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A4 menu safe insets

- Replaced the three-dot trigger's fixed top/end placement with Android
  system-bar and display-cutout insets. API 30+ reserves bars even while they
  are transiently hidden; API 28--29 uses stable/system/cutout fallbacks.
- The first safe placement put the card below the trigger and was rejected by
  the existing walker because the short landscape viewport hid the final
  action. The accepted card begins inside the safe top, covers its trigger
  while open, and reserves the bottom navigation inset.
- On the visible native 2400x1080 API 36 phone, WindowManager reported 63 px
  top/bottom system regions. The card rendered at y=84--975, above navigation
  beginning at y=1017, with the final row fully present.
- Emulator accelerometer input then drove the sensor-landscape activity to
  rotation 3. The 128 px cutout moved to the right/menu edge and the card moved
  left exactly 128 px. Added that safe-bound assertion and orientation restore
  to the complete phone menu walker.
- A stronger live-transition probe then exposed stale popup geometry when the
  rotation changed with the card already open. Resource orientation remained
  landscape, so Android did not send a configuration callback. Inset-edge
  changes now also dismiss the card and clear touch state. The automated gate
  requires dismissal, the inset trigger at x=2124--2240, and the reopened card
  at x=1400--2240.
- The complete menu walker passed 8 top/title rows, 5 Controls, 2 Display, 6
  Game Data rows, and 16 action destinations. The source-only and exact dual
  builds, strict APK audit, 110 tests with one skip, repository safety, and
  whitespace checks pass.
- Reinstalled unpublished exact dual APK
  `ab10b1e9bbd201ad2866d4f9b92d3349db2e541d32b9437f68504eb560b547d6`
  with `-r`; retained Retro/version/save hashes match and the visible selector
  shows Installed 6.12.5. Temporary captures/APK were moved to Trash.
- Classification: **Pass for API 36 phone-emulator system-bar/cutout-safe menu
  layout in both landscape orientations and complete action reachability; not
  OEM cutout, foldable, multi-window, or physical-device acceptance.** No
  APK/AAB was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a4-menu-safe-insets.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 retained Original runtime-root repair

- A release-derived Original launch with retained validated game data crashed
  on the SDL thread because `Config.toml` lacked `dvd_root`; selector validation
  had enabled a path the runtime could not use.
- Added a fail-closed selector repair that writes the relative `GameData` root.
  A subsequent repeat exposed blank-line drift, so the repair now returns
  unchanged when the installed line is already present.
- Three selector launches preserve the exact configuration hash. The final
  bundle-derived universal and device-split API 36 ARM64 gates both show the
  selector, render stable/diverse Original frames, and preserve durable state.
- Strict APK/AAB audits and all 110 repository tests pass with one intentional
  skip. Exact unpublished debug APK SHA-256 is `1db15ed1033e39f3fef7bced0039320dd57e6cc21edfe1d01e3fea50906a1535`;
  unsigned AAB SHA-256 is `25346d13084154ff75e4fdfd70c7a832a55d664a5679bea86900b49ad33f34d1`.
- Classification: **Pass for retained Original path repair and release-derived
  emulator runtime/state stability; not physical-device stability.** No build
  or private artifact was published. Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-retained-game-data-runtime-root.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android A6 preview 3 hardware candidate

- Promoted the private local phone candidate to
  `0.4.0-android-preview.3`, version code 8, so it is a forward upgrade from
  the prior tester line and includes the retained Original path correction.
- Two independent scoped clean builds produced identical unsigned AAB SHA-256
  `85a7e12d8ebccbaa313dc2740e86137a26c24d02ac47c7835d6019a60f1335d7`.
- The bundle-derived universal and four-part device-split API 36 ARM64 gates
  both passed selector, stable/diverse Original rendering, exact native/signer,
  debug restoration, and durable-state preservation.
- Retained the exact audited 90,502,311-byte non-debuggable APK locally at
  `.android-bootstrap/hardware-preview/KartPad-0.4.0-android-preview.3-v8-arm64.apk`
  with SHA-256
  `b709d5e42b08be0e276c2fc07ed25b1f34a58c31282c049d6505a390ee647707`.
  The guarded installer now pins those exact bytes and metadata.
- The sole connected target was the emulator; the installer rejected it before
  mutation, redacted its serial, and left installed version 7 byte-identical.
- Classification: **Pass for a reproducible, guarded, unpublished phone-test
  candidate; not physical-device stability or acceptance.** Evidence:
  `docs/artifacts/2026-09-05/android/a6-preview3-hardware-candidate.md`.

## 2026-09-05 — Android cross-machine physical handoff

- Added `docs/ANDROID-PHYSICAL-HANDOFF.md` as the exact other-machine runbook:
  fetch/switch the Android branch, privately transfer and hash-check preview 3,
  run the physical preflight, install without clearing data, execute the manual
  hardware matrix, and emit the UID-scoped sanitized summary.
- The document explicitly records that Git does not carry the ignored APK,
  private translation graph, game data, saves, credentials, or signing state.
  A source pull therefore cannot manufacture the already-audited full product
  unless the second machine also has the authorized ignored build inputs.
- An attempted extension of the release-derived emulator gate was rejected
  before commit: ADB cannot directly start the intentionally non-exported
  runtime activity, shell task-fronting left the compositor portrait, and the
  Recents-based split-package probe later stalled in `uiautomator dump` despite
  a focused landscape KartPad process. The runner was interrupted through its
  cleanup trap; installed debug version 7 and the selector were restored. No
  product failure is inferred and no unverified lifecycle-gate code remains.
- Classification: **Pass for a clean, documented, privacy-bounded machine and
  phone-test handoff; physical execution and performance remain open.**
