# KartPad documentation

[Coordinator runbook and implementation plan](MAINTENANCE-AUTOMATION.md) ·
[Canonical active queue](MAINTENANCE-BOARD.md).

For downloads, start with the [project README](../README.md#downloads).
The [expandable FAQ](../README.md#frequently-asked-questions) answers common
setup, controls, compatibility and troubleshooting questions.
Guides below describe current workflows; dated records describe only the build
and observations named in them.

## Maintain and release

| Task | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| Resume current work | [Handoff](HANDOFF.md), [maintenance workflow](MAINTENANCE.md), [work/test board](MAINTENANCE-BOARD.md) |
| Check requirements | [PRD](PRD.md), [engineering goal loop](GOAL-LOOP.md), [Android goal loop](ANDROID-GOAL-LOOP.md) |
| Prepare a release | [Release checklist](RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md), [Android publication](RELEASING_ANDROID.md), [upstream updates](UPSTREAM_UPDATES.md) |
| Plan deferred work | [Technical debt](TECH-DEBT.md), [future features](FUTURE-FEATURES.md), [research](RESEARCH.md) |
| Review attribution and rights | [Rights and licenses](../RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md), [third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md), [artwork provenance](../branding/PROVENANCE.md) |

## History and evidence

- [Release notes](releases/) describe individual shipped versions. The completed
  [0.4.4 validation record](releases/v0.4.4-validation.md) was formerly `NEXT.md`.
- [Artifacts](artifacts/) hold dated, sanitized test/build records and referenced
  captures. [Iterations](iterations/) retain device-specific development results.
- [Engineering journal](archive/JOURNAL.md), [early status ledger](archive/status-through-2026-09-07.md),
  [Android bring-up plan](archive/android-bringup-plan.md) and
  [old release checkpoints](archive/release-checkpoints-through-0.4.11.md)
  are historical. Their old candidates, local paths and pending actions are not
  instructions for the next session.

Keep the README focused on introduction, downloads, usage and its expandable FAQ.
Preserve useful user answers and controls guidance when shortening a page; move
detailed instructions to a linked guide rather than silently deleting them. Update current
summaries in place and link one dated record for detailed evidence. Preserve
release notes, license/provenance records and referenced artifacts; remove
superseded duplicate summaries rather than copying them into more running logs.
