# KartPad Personal IPA Builder

KartPad uses static recompilation. The public Builder translates a supported
game executable on the user's Mac before Apple signing. It remains useful for
developers and future verified compatibility profiles even though the latest
public preview also publishes one audited unsigned IPA containing the current
supported ARM64 translation.

## Current preview

The playable Builder profile is the pinned PAL
`RMCP01` revision 0 WBFS development image. It produces an unsigned,
personalized IPA for local signing. The Builder and compatibility metadata are
public; disc data, extracted files, translated code, signing material, and the
resulting IPA remain ignored and private.

The `mkwii-rmcj01-rev0` profile additionally recognizes the supplied Japanese
revision-0 ISO and validates its extracted DATA partition. Its status is
`macos-development`, not IPA `build-enabled`; the separate
`scripts/build-rmcj01-macos.sh` builds the Japanese ARM64 Mac runtime.
The separate `scripts/build-rmcj01-ios.sh` path now builds a Japanese iOS
candidate, including dual Original/Retro Rewind mode when given its J graph.
Physical-device and extended online acceptance are tracked separately in
[the extended ledger](RMCJ01-EXTENDED.md); this does not enable the generic
Personal IPA Builder path yet.
See [RMCJ01 port status](RMCJ01.md). `profiles` and `inspect` show the capability
boundary, and `build` rejects an incomplete port before dependency preparation
or reuse of an existing app/translation override.

Requirements are an Apple Silicon Mac, Xcode, CMake, Ninja, Git, ripgrep,
Python 3, .NET 8, and `nodtool` 2.0.0-alpha.9. Fetch the profile's exact pinned
source checkouts and hash-verified physical-iOS Dawn archive once:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh bootstrap
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh doctor
```

The bootstrap fetches only dependencies declared by the selected profile,
checks out exact commits, initializes their submodules, disables push URLs,
and fails rather than modifying an unexpected or dirty existing checkout.

Inspect an image without extracting it:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh inspect /path/to/Mario-Kart-Wii.wbfs
```

Reuse a previously extracted DATA partition, validating the full image hash,
disc identity, DOL hash, and REL hash without copying or modifying the folder:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh prepare /path/to/Mario-Kart-Wii.iso \
  --extracted-data /path/to/DATA
```

`inspect` and `build` also accept `--extracted-data`. For a fresh extraction,
use `prepare IMAGE --output DIRECTORY` instead. These input-only operations do
not require .NET, Xcode, Dawn, or Retro Rewind. Reusing an extraction does not
require `nodtool`; creating a new one requires the pinned extractor.

Build the private unsigned IPA:

```sh
./scripts/build-user-ipa.sh build /path/to/Mario-Kart-Wii.wbfs
```

The default output is ignored at
`artifacts/KartPad-personal-unsigned.ipa`. It contains translated code from the
user's game executable, whose redistribution rights KartPad does not clear.
The Builder records that game-content status separately from the GPLv3 software
license; it does not impose a blanket redistribution ban on GPL-covered code.

## Compatibility profiles

Profiles live in `builder/profiles/` and are versioned JSON. They keep these
concerns separate:

- accepted container formats and exact full-image hashes;
- disc ID, disc number, revision, and Wii magic;
- extracted DOL and REL identities;
- load addresses, memory layout, entry points, function map, injectors, and
  expected translation counts.
- explicit capability/status metadata for input-verified regions whose
  translation and runtime port is not yet complete. Unverified function maps
  and translation counts stay null rather than copying PAL expectations.

This design allows multiple verified WBFS/ISO container variants to point to
one static-recompilation profile when extraction proves they contain the same
DOL and REL. A different region or executable revision receives a separate
profile because addresses and generated code can change. Unknown inputs always
fail closed.

To add compatibility:

1. Verify the complete image and extract it read-only.
2. Record the container SHA-256 only after establishing legal provenance.
3. Compare the extracted DOL/REL hashes and disc header with an existing
   profile.
4. Add a container entry only if the executable identities are identical;
   otherwise create and validate a new profile.
5. Run `./scripts/test-kartpad-builder.sh` and a complete local build twice.

## Repeatable builds and cache safety

Validated extraction is cached by profile and complete input-image hash, so
ordinary code changes do not extract the same disc again. Build and translation
workspaces use a stricter key containing the input-image hash, canonical
profile hash, Builder pipeline version, tracked source index, and current source
diff. A code or profile change therefore cannot silently reuse an older app
workspace. Extraction and translation stages validate their manifests before
reuse and stage new extraction atomically. IPA ZIP entries are sorted, have fixed
timestamps, and preserve executable permissions, so the same audited app and
provenance produce byte-identical packages.

The IPA embeds a content-safe `KartPadBuilderProvenance.json` containing hashes
and profile identifiers, never local source paths. Packaging rejects disc
images, saves, provisioning profiles, signatures, and explicitly supplied
private path prefixes.

## Release boundary

The following is the maintainer's publication policy, not an additional
restriction on GPL rights. You may modify and redistribute the GPL-covered
Builder, runtime, and integration under the GPL, including commercially and
without separate maintainer approval. See
[`RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md`](../RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md).

The maintainer may publish the exact audited community-preview IPA produced by
`scripts/package-public-unsigned-ipa.py`. That package has versioned
provenance, license notices, deterministic ZIP metadata, no private game data,
and no signing material. Its translated-game-code and uncleared game-content
rights status must be stated plainly as documented in `RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md`.

Do not publish a generated translation directory, raw app bundle, personalized
Builder IPA, extracted game tree, save, signing certificate, or provisioning
profile. A local Builder output is not interchangeable with the exact public
release candidate.

The private development product passes a local Mac-to-iPad-Simulator online
race/results flow. Public-service, physical-device online, and external-client
acceptance remain separate from Builder compatibility and are not claimed for
this preview.
