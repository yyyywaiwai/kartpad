### Dolphin Emulator data files - GPL-2.0-or-later

Copyright (c) 2003+ Dolphin Emulator Project.
Source: <https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin> - license at
<https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/COPYING>

Two data sets from Dolphin's `Data/Sys` tree are redistributed here under GPL-2.0-or-later:

| File(s) | Upstream path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `runtime/assets/dsp/dsp_coef.bin` | `Data/Sys/GC/dsp_coef.bin` | Free DSP polyphase-resampling coefficient ROM written by the Dolphin team. 4096 bytes, SHA-256 `D7741279C2E8EC5C5FB318F8FBDD6DE6BF583520D288E836A5383233A4238179`. The runtime verifies this hash at build time. |
| `runtime/assets/wii/shared2/wc24/**` | `Data/Sys/Wii/shared2/wc24` | Dolphin's unmodified default WiiConnect24 bootstrap tree, used to seed a newly created per-user NAND on first run. It is byte-identical to the upstream directory. `nwc24dl.bin` contains Dolphin's default task list, which references Nintendo endpoints shut down in 2014; `nwc24msg.cfg` contains Dolphin's placeholder account fields, not a real user's account data. |

Neither contains Nintendo executable code or game assets; both are redistributed under
GPL-2.0-or-later from Dolphin's `Data/Sys` tree.

SHA-256 hashes for the WiiConnect24 bootstrap tree:

Dolphin was also used extensively as a behavioural reference during development of this project's
hardware and IOS high-level implementations.

### Dolphin Emulator Riivolution code - GPL-2.0-or-later

Copyright (c) 2021 Dolphin Emulator Project.
The runtime's Riivolution patch handling is a port of Dolphin's
`Source/Core/DiscIO/RiivolutionParser.{h,cpp}` and the external-path resolution rules of
`Source/Core/DiscIO/RiivolutionPatcher.cpp`, adapted in
`runtime/include/hle/riivolution_contract.h` and `runtime/src/hle/storage/riivolution.cpp`
(both marked `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`).

## Fetched at build time and redistributed in release builds

These are pinned in `aurora-main/extern/CMakeLists.txt` and
`aurora-main/cmake/AuroraDawnProvider.cmake`. They are not stored in this repository; the build
downloads them, and release installers carry the resulting binaries. Their license texts are
included in the installer's `licenses/` folder.

## Bundled in the setup executable's toolkit payload

The distributed `WiiCompiled-Setup.exe` carries a build toolkit so that translation and
compilation can run on a machine with nothing preinstalled. These tools are redistributed
unmodified, with their license texts, in the installer's `licenses/` folder.

| Component | License | Upstream |

| llvm-mingw (Clang, LLD, libc++, libunwind, MinGW-w64 runtime) | Apache-2.0 with LLVM Exception; MinGW-w64 runtime under its own permissive terms; bundled GNU utilities under GPL-2.0-or-later or GPL-3.0-or-later | <https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw> |

## Reference material

Not code, but the documentation this project depends on:

- [WiiBrew](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/) - Wii hardware and IOS documentation.
- [Custom Mario Kart Wiiki (Tockdom)](https://wiki.tockdom.com/) - Mario Kart Wii file formats and
  modding documentation.
