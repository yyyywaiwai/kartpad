// byte swap, no page-table load/branch. Two views alias the same physical memory: the GUEST
// view at kFlatGuestBase has page protections as the interception mechanism (unmapped/MMIO/
// executable/deferred-read pages are uncommitted or protected), while the HOST view is a plain
// alias native runtime code (image loading, DVD reads, HLE, GX) writes through unchecked.
