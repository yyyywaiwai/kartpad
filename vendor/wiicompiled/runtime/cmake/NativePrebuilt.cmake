# same canonical flag set the consuming build uses, which is what makes a single
# package valid for every user. Nothing about this project's own code changes:
# the runtime, the translated shards and the products still compile locally and
# still link targets named aurora::gx / aurora::pad / aurora::si / aurora::vi /
# aurora::mtx, so cmake/PublicProducts.cmake needs no prebuilt-specific branch.
#
# The aurora and dependency source trees are still present in the workspace - the
# runtime includes aurora headers directly - so the package records include
# directories as tokens (@AURORA@, @RUNTIME@, @DEPS@, @PKG@) that resolve here
# rather than baking a maintainer machine's paths into a redistributable.
