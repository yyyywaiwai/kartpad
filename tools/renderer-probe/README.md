# KartPad renderer probe

A separate Android diagnostic app for [#102](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/102)
and [#104](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/kartpad/issues/104). It uses synthetic
inputs and extracts the packed-data WGSL functions from the pinned Aurora source.
It does not load KartPad, translated game code, game data, saves, network accounts,
or device identifiers. The app has no permissions and does not send results
until the user selects **Share Results** and a destination.

This is an investigation tool, not a graphics fix or a playable KartPad update.
Its package is `dev.kartpad.rendererprobe`; installing it does not replace
`dev.kartpad.android`. No reinstall or storage clearing of KartPad is needed.

## Run

Open **KartPad Renderer Check**, tap **Run GPU Check**, then **Share Results**.
Keep the app open during the test. Post the text to the relevant issue after
reviewing it. Include whether Original, Retro Rewind, or both show corruption.

Four variants compare 4,096 values each against an independent CPU decoder:

- Scalar uniform array, bounds protection disabled.
- Vector-packed uniform array, bounds protection disabled.
- Scalar uniform array, bounds protection enabled.
- Vector-packed uniform array, bounds protection enabled.

WebGPU validation remains enabled in every variant. Each uses a fresh adapter
and device; the selected backend is Vulkan on Android and Metal on macOS.
Software adapters are rejected before device creation because the pinned Dawn
library aborts in its SwiftShader device-toggle setup. There is no fallback
to a different graphics backend. GPU callbacks have a
five-second timeout; shader compilation and driver calls can take longer.

Tests include every byte alignment, both byte orders, signed 16-bit fixed-point
vectors, 24-bit colors, finite 32-bit floats, scalar array indexing, and dynamic
indexing of 20 three-column matrices. Values are read back from a compute pass.
Field numbers in a mismatch report mean:

| Field | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | unsigned byte |
| 1–2 | little/big-endian unsigned 16-bit |
| 3–4 | little/big-endian unsigned 32-bit |
| 5–8 | four signed big-endian 16-bit values divided by 256 |
| 9–10 | little/big-endian 24-bit color |
| 11 | uniform array offset |
| 12–14 | matrix transform components |
| 15 | big-endian finite float |

A pass only validates these synthetic compute cases. It does not validate the
vertex/fragment stages, textures, actual GX draw streams, buffer reuse,
presentation, frame pacing, or gameplay on that device. A mismatch is evidence
for a smaller follow-up case, not automatic proof of a driver bug. Error reports
are distinct from value mismatches.

## Build

Use KartPad's pinned Android bootstrap/dependencies, then:

```sh
scripts/build-android-renderer-probe.sh
```

The result is an unsigned release APK under
`tools/renderer-probe/android/build/outputs/apk/release/`. The script does not
install, sign, or publish it. Public candidates must be non-debuggable, signed
with a persistent release identity, audited, and anonymously downloaded back
before linking them to reporters. Do not publish a hardware debug-signed APK.

For a local macOS baseline, using the existing pinned Dawn installation:

```sh
cmake -S tools/renderer-probe -B build/renderer-probe -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/absolute/path/to/dawn
cmake --build build/renderer-probe
build/renderer-probe/kartpad_renderer_probe
```

The CLI exits nonzero on a mismatch or error. The report includes a SHA-256 of
the exact extracted helpers. The generator reads only Aurora's `shader.cpp`.
KartPad probe code is GPL-3.0-only; extracted Aurora code retains its MIT license.
The APK includes root GPL, Aurora, Dawn, and NDK toolchain notices.

The `licenses/` copies come from Dawn source
`13abc3bc8ea2d3c2050f9e77a12d012108ceee24` and the existing pinned Abseil
source. They cover Dawn and the relevant bundled/header dependencies; no game
runtime or game content is linked. Android's static C++ runtime is covered by
the packaged NDK toolchain notices.

An excluded `kartpad_renderer_probe_cli` target is available for authorized
ADB development. It runs the same probe without a Java UI, so a locked screen
does not prevent the synthetic GPU check. Do not substitute CLI acceptance
for testing the APK's buttons and sharing flow.
