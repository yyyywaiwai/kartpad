# KartPad app icon provenance

## iPhone and iPad K-circuit icon

The current iOS and iPadOS icon is original project artwork selected on
2026-09-01. OpenAI's built-in image-generation tool produced the raster master
at `branding/KartPadIcon-k-circuit-ai.png`; its SHA-256 is
`94f5dc82a3e53bb6dd7d157449b2f2881c1747de23061f8ba6c924a92ab7df01`.

The prompt requested a generic top-down kart on a broad K-shaped circuit,
midnight-navy surroundings, cyan track lighting, and an orange kart. It
expressly excluded text, logos, characters, recognizable Mario Kart vehicles
or items, controllers, Apple branding, watermarks, and trademarked trade dress.

`scripts/generate-ios-icon-assets.sh` deterministically crops and downsamples
the master to the opaque universal 1024×1024 AppIcon asset used by both iOS and
iPadOS. The production PNG's SHA-256 is
`eb2a9f0c4fdfc78d78f9ab6052104c66a9c7a405336cda70e6f6b2dcd78300bd`.
Xcode applies the system-generated dark and tinted treatments from that single
high-resolution icon.

## tvOS layered icon

The tvOS icon and Top Shelf image are original KartPad project artwork derived
from the repository-owned abstract K-circuit SVG described below. The tvOS
catalog separates the opaque midnight background, circuit rings, and K mark
into three layers so Apple TV can apply its native focus and parallax effects.
It contains no extracted Wii banner, Nintendo image, game screenshot, course,
character, vehicle, item, or other user-supplied game data.

The editable tvOS layer masters are under `branding/tvos/`; their compiled PNG
counterparts are under `apple/tvos/Assets.xcassets/`. The background layer is
opaque, foreground layers preserve transparency, and the primary icon content
is kept inside the wide-icon safe area.

## Original abstract and macOS icon

The KartPad icon is original project artwork created on 2026-08-28. OpenAI's built-in image-generation tool produced the initial concept at `branding/KartPadIcon-concept-ai.png`; its SHA-256 is `9e0b4a62d1be64e5108b2b5d9fa2a5611683c0709b1d5baf2c8685afd383ed60`.

The prompt requested a generic abstract wheel/track ring, a geometric K-shaped track curve, and forward-motion marks on a midnight background. It expressly excluded Nintendo and Mario Kart logos, characters, karts, game wheels, courses, items, textures, screenshots, checkerboard flags, controllers, Apple branding, watermarks, and trademarked trade dress.

`KartPadIcon.svg` is the editable original master authored for this repository
from that concept. `KartPadIcon-Dark.svg` and `KartPadIcon-Tinted.svg` are its
appearance variants. They remain the source of the current macOS `.icns`, but
are no longer referenced by the iOS/iPadOS AppIcon set.

`branding/exports/KartPad.icns` is the macOS bundle icon generated from the opaque production export. Its ten standard and Retina members validate at 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 pixels; its SHA-256 is `2c83d844e0fe895cae99bc4ed8ea976a969b3035833373c39af31247b17ea7b8`.

## macOS icon alignment in 0.4.9

The macOS ICNS and all of its standard/Retina sizes now derive from the exact
shipped iPhone/iPad `AppIcon.appiconset/KartPadIcon-1024.png` K-circuit artwork,
using `scripts/generate-macos-icon-assets.sh`. The earlier vector icon and its
old ICNS hash above are historical. The package audit compares the bundled ICNS
with the current export to prevent an old logo from shipping again.
